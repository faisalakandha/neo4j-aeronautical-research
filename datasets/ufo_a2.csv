Equipment used for Sighting:  Binoculars I was in a motel room on second floor. I wanted to try out my new binoculars, so went outside on the balcony. I immediately noticed flashing colored lights in one area. I focused the binoculars on the lights. The ufo I saw was in the sky, and was a black triangle with different colored lights flashing on all 3 sides of the object. The ufo was hovering and appeared to be not moving in any direction. The colored lights on the 3 sides of the ufo were flashing. I stayed on the balcony for half an hour, despite the zero degree temperature because the object fascinated me and I wanted to be certain it was not a plane or a planet. The flashing lights outlined a black triangle so the shape of the ufo was definitely a triangle. I zoomed my binoculars in on other objects i.e. stars, etc. The stars had no colored lights and were not flashing; they were stationary white stars. I finally concluded this was definitely a triangle shaped ufo with various colors of flashing lights on all 3 sides of the triangle, and that the object was hovering in the sky.

6,28,21,2 hours,"Highly erratic flight pattern by unknown object flying around multiple other common aircraft. This happened in South Charleston, WV. I even mapped the geographical coordinates of where we were laying. I and another witness were at 38.32238,-8172043 laying on a set of monkey bars behind a school both facing northeast. I noticed the object first. It was a yellowish glow high in the sky and I made a joke about how that star looked like it was moving. Upon further investigation I noticed it had been moving. From what I could see it was flying around the same elevation as most aircraft were that night. The night was clear and no cloud coverage at all. There were a lot of other aircraft and one aircraft even flew right into the yellow glowing object, however it looked as if it passed over top of it. The object had no particular flight pattern and moved erratically. Based on surrounding aircraft I would assume it flew at over a 600 miles per hour and would stop and switch directions quickly. It moved in every direction, left to right, up and down, and they weren’t always constant flight patterns. They would also fly from left to right and then slowly sweep upward in a curved motion.  There were multiple other aircraft that were all easily identified even when they were flying at a higher altitude and this flight pattern matched no aircraft possible in the area and had no hazard lights to let you know that it was a normal aircraft. The sighting occurred 6/28/12 from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30 pm. We watched the object move to many different areas of the sky. We actually looked up and placed it to be flying around the Hercules constellation from where we were laying. I took great care to include all accurate details and did have  a witness. This is my first sighting of an object like this, and I’m sure it was no meteor (there was a meteor shower) and I’m positive it was no local aircraft I’ve ever viewed. I tried to film it on my iPhone, unfortunately the ambient light from the light pole wouldn’t allow it to focus and concentrate on the beam. The object was too far away to determine a shape, but it was definitely highly illuminated. We even wondered while watching it how the aircraft could not notice or see this or maybe they had.

I was traveling eastward when I observed 3 rather large rose colored or strawberry colored lights in a tight formation with the center light slightly higher.

I than observed a 4th object in the sky, this object appeared to be closer and larger moving very slowly in a southeasterly direction.

9,7,20,10 minutes,"Yellow/Orange fireball type objects flying in triangular formation hovering just north of the La Crosse, WI airport over Lake Onalaska From approximately 20:20 to 20:28 I witnessed 12 fireball shaped objects in the sky that were flying in formation.  Four separate triangular shaped formations, which consisted of 3 fireball objects in each triangular formation.  At different times, one fireball object would break away from their triangular formation and move in very rapid movement; appearing to move horizontally away from their group of three fireballs and then rapidly rejoin their formation after 3 to 4 rapid movements away from their group of three.  The four groups of three went from a straight line and then formed a “V” shape almost like a flight of geese does.  I spoke with three other individuals who also saw it, but I also witnessed other people along my drive who were pointing to them in the sky.  This took place over Lake Onalaska, just north of the La Crosse airport, between La Crosse, WI and Onalaska, WI.  The fireballs moved too erratically and were shaped too round to be convent! ional, manmade aircraft.

They had the ability to hover, but they also had the ability to move very quickly as well.  I’ve never witnessed anything like it.  I was driving south on Hwy 35 and attempted to call my wife on my cell phone who was at a friend’s house to see if she could see what I was witnessing and my cell phone was unable to get a signal to complete the call.  The area I was in always has a cellular signal available, but I can only speculate that the objects in the sky had the ability to disrupt the cellular signal, because once they were no longer visible, the cellular communications were restored.  When I made it to the location where my wife was at, three other people at the house saw what I was talking about; the strange thing is, from their location only three of the fireball objects were visible…again I can only speculate that from their! perspective the other objects were cloaked.  Cellular signals! were sp otty for the rest of the night.

11,6,14,20 minutes,"3 orb-like objects, one caught on video On November 6th at about 2pm central time, my wife and I were loading some items into a trailer in preparation for a move.  She sat down to take a short break and scanned the sky. Watching the sky when we are outside is and has been a habit we've adopted over the last 2-3 years.  A minute or two into her break she noticed an object in the northeastern sky and pointed it out to me. It was difficult to locate but I was able to do so by using environmental reference points such as trees and the house.  What I saw appeared to me at first like a bright star as it was a stationary object but considering the time of day and the fact it was sunny and 65 degrees made this an unlikely explanation.  I cannot stress enough how difficult it was to see this thing. Unless you had your eyes directly trained on it, it vanished from sight even though it seemed to be metallic and reflecting sunlight. If my wife wouldn't have spotted it there's no way I would have seen it.  At this moment, I ran inside to get my son to see it for himself, which he did but only after directing him where to look exactly.  We sat there staring at it when my wife pointed out two other objects approaching from the southeast.  One looked like the object to the north but moving slow and the other had a reddish color but seemed to bend and twist as it moved towards our direction.  It changed course a few times going left or right and moved at about half the speed of a mid to high altitude airliner appears to move.  These objects also seemed to ""disappear"" when not focused directly on them so when I looked away it took effort to find them once again. At this point I ran into the house to get my camcorder which is a Panasonic HC-W570.  I knew that I had 35-40 minutes of battery left but when I got outside and started to try and find the objects again, the battery indicator dropped all the down and I didn't even get a chance to record a single frame before it just died.  Disappointed, my family and I continued to watch.  The two moving o! bjects h ad fully vanished or faded but the original one still remained.  That's when I had the idea to grab the power supply for the camcorder and plug it in to an exterior outlet at the front door. It took me a few minutes to get close to zooming in on the UFO as the camera doesn't have a physical viewfinder, only the lcd screen.  Zooming into 90x also makes any handheld camerawork very unstable. Eventually, using the trees in the front of the house as a reference for locating the object in the sky, I got lucky for just a couple seconds to be able to get it in focus.  Almost as if it was playing hard to get, it would move just close enough to the tree in my line of sight for the camera to lose focus and shift to focusing on the branches.  So each time I would have to readjust my position by a few inches and start over again trying to find it in the sky.  After all this, the UFO faded into the color of the sky and ended our 20 minutes of excitement and bewilderment.","White and red blinking light moving across horizon, slowing down to a stop, then vanishing.",MEQUON,WI,CHANGING,2016,1.082744007,0.629104821,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-0.060673707,0,0,NA,0.008129116,0,-1.255040748,0,NA,WSW,CLEAR

9,26,20,2+ Hours,"I was driving home from Hudson, and had just driven through River Falls when I spotted the first one. It was a very bright light, larger than any star and seemed to be falling fairly fast; it got dimmer and dimmer until I couldn’t see it anymore. I was almost to Beldenville when I spotted another. I pulled off on to a side road to get a better look. There were as many as six objects flying in large circles. At the closest part of the circle they were bright and large like the first one I saw; as they got further away they looked to have one red light and one green light, and very fast flashing white lights that ran along the length of it. I watched them for a while then decided to move on. Just before Ellsworth I saw them again; again I pulled off onto a side road. I saw one very close this time; it consisted of a row of five red lights. It was flying very low and it was wider than the road I was on, yet it made no sound. When it started to circle it banked so sharply that the lights went from being horizontal to being completely vertical. While going east on hwy 10, between about eleven miles out side of Ellsworth, one flew over me. This one was very irregularly shaped, with the same red and green and flashing white lights. While it was over head, I spotted another just like it in my rear view mirror, at first I thought it was the same one, but I looked over my shoulder and there were two of them. When I got home I could still see them, little more than flashing lights on the horizon, I brought my dad out side and showed him.

I also noticed a much fainter reddish star which seemed to be moving.  As I watched it picked up speed and arced behind the trees.  The distance seemed to be substantial but I could not hazard a guess.  I’m guessing because the object was very small and faint and could easily be missed. Then I saw another one and then another and another.   Probably happened 7 or 8 times when I went inside to have my wife look,(to make sure I wasn’t crazy). She came out but we only saw one more. I looked again on Thursday night but it was after 11pm and I saw nothing. On Friday night, I went out at about the same time that I saw them on Wednesday and sure enough, I started seeing them again. They seem not to move fast at first but then accelerate rapidly and usually arcing either north or south.  At least one did go in a straight line from approximately north to south.  Whether one craft reappearing or several I do not know. This morning I went out and checked my landmarks and came in and brought up goole earth.  When I run a straight line from my position through the direction I was looking, I end up over McChord afb. These lights did not look like planes to me.  I saw no blinking lights and if they were over McChord, they were much faster than any type of plane, military or not, that I’m aware of.   Maybe some kind of flare but that doesn’t account for their pattern of flight nor speed. I’m a skeptic on ufo sightings but do think there are real sightings of things that cannot be eexplained.

I looked towards The Clockum Area and there were 4 Amber colored lights in the sky all at different heights in the sky.  I noticed one begin to move upwards and the one next to it followed.  I called to my two friends to look at what I was seeing.  They saw the same thing.   We watched as these 4 lights moved up and down several hundred feet at a time. 2 of the lights would be moving while the other two held still.  After watching for a minute I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look at what we were seeing.   What I saw still is difficult for me to describe.  This craft seemed to have more than one level, at least 2. It was pulsating and there's was so much going on with the lights inside this large object.  The object was orange/Amber in color.  One object appeared to have a globe shape on the top.  I handed the binoculars to my friend and asked her what she saw.  She couldn't speak for bit. She too couldn't believe what she was seeing, and was having difficulty explaining it.  After seeing the first two thru the binoculars, I went to look at the other two lights and they were gone.  My friend saw it shoot straight up into the sky while I was looking at the others.   The 2 remaining lights were still hovering and moving around in the sky, traveling what appeared to be several miles at a time in any one direction, but stayed over the Clockum area, but they too then disappeared straight up into the sky.

They stayed like that for about 3 minutes.  The top one disappeared upwards and the other two started moving to the far right and stayed together for a long time.   Then they would disappear and re-emerge.  It started getting light out and they all disappeared.

I'm not sure if it was light grey, or just was just shiny and reflecting what light was there.  I can't have been the only person to see this craft.   Everyone on the i90 bridge at that time would have noticed the giant rainbow and then maybe seen the same craft.

It didn’t move, so watching it with my binoculars it sent out red lights along the edge of the craft like a car with tail lights moving in one direction.  So, I thought it might be a satellite.   When it sent out the red lights in a row like I said, I got creeped out and went to bed, thinking it must be a satellite.

My friend, who was riding in the passenger seat, said,  "" What the hell is that?""   When he said that, out of the corner of my right eye, I saw something dive down out of the clouds.  What I saw and my friend said he saw were two different things. What I remember seeing, was a long, maybe 20ft. in length, and ten feet in width, flying object. I was going about 60 miles per hour, and the object after diving down out of the clouds, leveled off and seemed to be going faster than we were driving. I could see the outline of the object, but the middle of the object seemed to be translucent. While trying to drive and look up at this object, the object, even though flying straight, seemed to turn and look towards us. I remember I saw what I can only describe as two eyes, that were about the size of can of pop in circumference, and bright blue, look back towards us. Whatever I saw, then flew back up into the clouds.  I believe the cloud cover was not too high that night.

8,12,7,1 second,"I saw my second UFO ever shooting down to the ground and basically vanish or sink into the ground somehow. The second UFO I've ever seen was a weird object that was witnessed by not only myself, but my cousin as well. It was still somewhat light out but getting darker by the minute. My cousin was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat, dully gazing not out of my window, but rather the reflections of the lights of a store we were passing that was reflecting off my window.  This part is kind of ironic and amusing as, still looking at the reflections of the lights, I said to my cousin, ""Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a..""   Now, the amusing and ironic part is that had I finished my sentence, I'd have said, ""Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a UFO.""  That's because the reflection of the lights from the store we were passing did look like a large ship, although after that split second when I realized that it was in fact, just the reflection of the store lights, something shot down from the sky. We saw it outside through the front of the car, and the sighting caught me off guard and I didn't even finish talking. This was a light or orb-like object, made of a kind of LED-like light with a blueish tint; however, it was so fast, that the sighting itself was only for a split second. It was somewhat funny actually, because my cousin asked if I saw that and I remember saying something along the lines of, “I'm not the only one who saw that? Good!” 	Besides it just being a light orb, the sighting played out like this: just as I was about to finish my sentence, my shock and surprise of the UFO made me hush up and my cousin and I watched as an LED-like ball of light – a large ball or orb mind you – randomly came out of the sky seemingly from nowhere, but instead of like the first UFO where it just kind of flickered in and out from nowhere, this one came flying from overhead, and it fell or shot down maybe three-hundred yards away from us and “vanished” before it hit the ground.  I put vanish in quotes because there was a solid concrete gate or fence blocking our view from the ground where it would have crashed, but because we couldn't see, we truly don't know what happened to this object; if it had been any other object such as a plane, helicopter, jet or anything else, we were close enough to not only hear it crash but to see any flames or an explosion, but we saw nor heard any explosion or flames. On top of that, planes! , helicopters and jets don't just show up out of nowhere, aren't shaped like an orb or large circle, are not that fast as this thing was – even if they were falling to the ground! – and aren't made entirely of light. If it had been a shooting star, it would have had a tail, it wouldn't have looked like it was made of LED light, it would not have come out of nowhere, and one of that size and magnitude and one falling/crashing that close to us, would have had serious even fatal affects on my cousin and I, as in once again, we would have heard and seen an explosion and maybe would have even died from it.

5,3,21,5 minutes,"Large triangular shaped orange light hovering minutes over my home. At 9pm on May 3rd while watering the flowers in the front yard of my home I looked up in the sky to see an orange light slowly coming towards my house about a mile up in the sky.  Living close to a naval station I am quite aware of the types of aircraft that frequent the area.  This light however was different in that as it approached was a brilliant burnt orange and moved gracefully and silent towards my home.  As it came into view, it did not resemble aircraft of anything I am used to seeing, ie..Life flight, charter planes, 737's etc.  This light slowed and then hovered above my street, and was absolutely silent, it glowed a beautiful orange, appearing at first triangular in shape becoming  super bright then shrunk to the size of a small star in the sky turning bright white.  After a moment it resumed its original size.  It remained in a stationary position until I ran up to my front window to alert my husband who was in the house.  I was probably gone 3 seconds from where I was originally standing when I looked up and noted it had disappeared.  I quickly went for a walk thru the neighborhood and could not locate it.  I live on a bluff over looking the water and had it been a normal aircraft I could have easily caught up with it.  This one, however I could not.  In all honesty, I felt like it was merely observing, and for whatever reason I was able to see it.

10,2,2,20min - 30min,"A bright yellowish light over the I-5 freeway in Western Washington. This sighting occurred at about 2:00am during the first week of October 2007 while I was visiting my parents in Washington State.  I had just gotten off the phone with my fiancé and was settling down to read myself to sleep on the fold-out bed in the living room.  I was lying on my stomach, absorbed in my book, when a strange feeling of something being amiss suddenly washed over me.  I can't really explain the feeling better than that; it simply seemed as though something was not quite right. I looked out of the open window, which was directly in front of me at the head of the bed.  This window faces east and overlooks a high school football field at the bottom of the hill that my parents' house sits on.  Beyond the field lies Broadway Ave. and a section of I-5, and beyond that one has a view of the countryside, the small town of Snohomish, and the Cascade Mountains way off in the distance. Peering out the window, I didn't see or hear anything unusual, just some cars zipping along the freeway and a few lights dotting the foothills of the Cascades.  I shook my head and silently scolded myself for being silly and went back to my book.  After a few moments I glanced out the window again and saw a light in the sky off in the distance.  This light was quite bright and seemed to shift colors; it went back and forth very slowly between muddy yellow and pale orange.  I assumed it was just a helicopter checking out the traffic on the freeway, but I kept watching it anyway.  It stayed in one spot, not moving at all, and I suddenly realised that it couldn't be a helicopter, at least not any kind of helicopter I'm familiar with.  The light it was giving off was all wrong.  What's more, I couldn't hear a thing other than the windchimes on the porch and the traffic on the roads.  Sounds carry very well in that part of the state, and had it been any kind of conventional aircraft I'm certain that I would have been able to hear and identify it. I turned off the lamp next to my bed and lay in the dark watching the light.  It hovered over I-5 for about 10 minutes, then drifted slowly to the south, along the line of the freeway, and was concealed by a stand of pine trees about 500 feet from the house.  I figured it had gone away, but I stayed in the dark and continued to look out the window.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the light suddenly reappeared from behind the trees.  It moved north and took up its former position over the road and just hovered there, not doing much of anything that I could see.  It stayed in that spot for about 5 to 10 minutes. I started to feel uneasy; I squeezed my eyes shut, lowered my head, and counted to ten.  When I glanced out of the window again the light was gone.  I looked all over the sky but there wasn't a trace of it anywhere. I waited for a bit to see if it would come back, but it never did.  Finally I turned the lamp on and picked up my book, eventually falling asleep sometime around 3:00am.  Nothing else of note happened the rest of the time I was visiting. I would like to note that I did not feel at all threatened by this light, and if it was a UFO I very much doubt that the intentions of the pilots were hostile in any way.  I have the feeling that whoever, if anyone, was inside this craft was simply interested in seeing what the freeway was all about.  I did feel uneasy, as I said, but this mostly because I was faced with something strange, something I could not explain. I have been sitting on this story for a year, too embarrassed to tell it to anyone aside from my fiancé.  I am above all else a realist, and when I see something strange I like to exhaust all mundane explanations before I label the experience paranormal.  I have been very intrigued the UFO phenomenon for years, though, and I firmly believe that our vast universe is capable of supporting life on distant planets.  Why those lifeforms should be interested in visiting Earth is beyond me, but as long as they're not engaging in harmful activities, I say the more the merrier.

11,1,18,20 minutes,"Two different UFO craft seen at same time about 3 miles apart THIS IS ABOUT THE:  Sightings of two different UFOs within moments of each other in central Washington State, November 1999. LOCATION:  13 miles north of EPHRATA (pronounced E - frA - ta), WASHINGTON, on Sagebrush Flats Road.  (Sagebrush Flats Road goes at a North by Northwest track from the town of Ephrata to the south.)   TIME:  about 7 pm PST (Dark outside), November 1999   SETTING ONE:  About 13 miles northwest of Ephrata, Sagebrush Flats Road comes out of a small canyon (gentle rolling hills on either side of the road) onto a 2 mile wide (north to south) and 5 mile long flat area with wheat farms and high power transmission lines.  The lines are suspended upon the very tall erector-set towers such lines are usually found on.  The high power lines cut across the flats coming from the Northeast (Grand Coulee Dam) and going to the Southwest. As I was traveling north and approaching the high power lines, I noticed a very bright light traveling very slowly (maybe 10 miles an hour) an estimated 20-50 feet above the lines.  It was to the northeast and coming towards me – as the road intersects under the lines at a 90 degree angle. The single light was very bright; such that I couldn’t see the craft behind it. Not wanting to be directly under the craft when it got to my location, I went maybe 1/8th mile north on the road – all the while watching the light. I stopped the car and got out to watch.  There was absolutely NO sound from the craft holding the light.  I watched as the light came to the road and made a 90 degree turn to its left and slowly followed Sagebrush road south.  As it slowly, and at a very low altitude, approached the small canyon, the canyon and adjacent rolling hills were illuminated as if it was a bright summer day.  Since the craft/light was now going away from me, I could not see the light, just the effects of the lights illumination.  I still could not see nor hear the craft holding the light. I watched for maybe 10-15 minutes. SETTING TWO:  My home is about three miles northwest (as a crow flies) of where I saw the light. When I got home to my wife, I said to her, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  My wife excitedly interrupted with, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  She went on to tell me that 15-20 minutes before I got home (the same time frame of my sighting) she had stepped outside and looked up to the east.  Hovering, maybe 50 feet above her was a very large (an estimated 150 feet to each side) black triangular shaped craft.  It made no sound.  At each corner were several small bright orange/red lights.  These corner lights gave enough definition of the craft for her to tell it was triangular.  She watched for maybe two minutes and then, out of fear, stepped back into the building. There isn’t any way these two craft (my light carrier and my wife’s black triangular craft) could be the same craft.  It seems too much of a coincidence that these two craft were in the same general area at the same time.  I’ve always wondered if the light bearing craft was looking for the triangular craft.  That possibly, the triangular craft was hugging the ground for stealth reasons.","When driving down Lawrence Avenue from 9th street towards 6th, I looked to the left and saw an object full of light flying straight dow",EPHRATA,WA,TRIANGLE,1999,1.699133301,-0.954456692,0,NA,0.723056723,0,2.868934954,-1.159936042,0,0,NA,0.373899236,0,-0.731823349,0,NA,NNW,OVERCAST

I experienced a psychedelic flashback while staring at the &quot;star&quot; and walking, where I was trapped walking in place(the road beneath me was moving, and a fence I was walking by was still panning past me), and the star seemed to be the only object that was normal within that period, which seemed like eternity.  Terrified, the thought of the star being a UFO and inducing my trip occurred to me and I was able to come out of that state. I'd been observing the star for a good 4 minutes. After, I'd walked past a tree that had blocked my view of the object, and once passed the obstacle, the star was gone.

8,10,2,7 minutes,"Bright flashing light too fast to be anything but a ufo following me in my truck I came over a rolling hill with a few trees directly ahead of me and I saw a bright flashing light in the shape of a circle just beyond the trees and as the road curved a noticed that the bright flashing light did not go as the road did it stayed in the pretty much the same spot through my windshield even though I had changed direction maybe 30 degrees.  That's when I knew that it was moving at the same speed as my truck.  And then it was on the other side of my truck almost as if it was pinned on me, for the next few minutes it traveled through rolling hills switching sides being in the front and then gone and then I'm the rear. It was a bright white light that flashed in roughly 1-2 seconds segments.   And it appeared to be only one, but I took a video through my side mirror and you can see the flashes moving in a direction and then the next flash it was well behind that, faster than any man made machine could possibly have done.  This occurrence also happened after I was at a rest stop and felt my uhaul truck swaying and I look at the long grass and trees and there was minimal wind it would take gusts to rock it the way it was rocking while the truck was not turned on.  I didn't think anything of it, but I felt that there was someone in the back and went an opened the back gate and even asked whoever was in there to please get out that it was not safe to ride with all the furniture.  Saw and heard nothing.   Got back into the cab and after a short time the rocking proceeded.  I banged on the back of the truck and said at least ride up here with me I have potato chips I can share, and to keep me company, as I was just joking not thinking anyone was in there but to take my mind off of it cuz it was making me paranoid.  Well, after the strange encounter with the flashing light that followed me for a good 5-10 miles it slowly disappeared into the distance very high in the air.  I got out to check the back again and the lights on the outside ! of the truck were flickering, just enough for me to notice as ! the were not flickering before the flashing unknown object laid before me.   I fell asleep in the truck an hour down the road and proceeded to call it hallucinations for the exhaustion from moving all day and driving all night.   That evening after work, I was telling someone about my hallucinations and how real it seemed and how paranoia can really mess with someone's head, when I remembered I took 2 short videos of the occurrence in a quick manner and had not looked at them yet.  Expecting not to see anything, it terrified me to see the light as I had seen it the night before on that very dark country highway leading into Colfax, Washington, and I even called my wife during the whole thing to tell her how scared I was and asking why is this light following me.  She even thought I was just tripping.    Well after I saw the videos I have never been more scared to be outside after dark, it really puzzled me on how real this was and how much it seemed to be a fantasy in a made up story book.

12,12,17,7-10 minutes,"Red/orange light over Bellingham, Washington My 22 year old son and I had just left my house, heading southwest. Straight ahead, about a 45 degree angle, we saw a single medium to bright light. I asked him to watch it as I was driving. I asked him to look for the red and green sidelights to see if it was a plane. He could not see anything. He mentioned that we could be seeing the headlight(s) of a small plane. I said that I didn’t think they had headlights of that color. I made a left 90 degree turn. The light was nearing our position, so I could not see it anymore but he could. He rolled down his window to listen for noises. He could hear nothing. When I got to the next intersection there was a store there with a large parking lot. I pulled in and parked, turned off my lights and engine and got out of the car. By the time I saw it again it was almost directly above me and moving slowly to the North. My son asked if it could be a helicopter and again, I didn’t think they had lights of that color. He suggested that it might be a hot air balloon. The color of the light did look like it could be a flame of some sort, being a red/orange shade. That made the most sense, although if it were a balloon you would be able to see the outline of the balloon as the flame would ignite the air inside the balloon, giving us a good view of the shape and size of the balloon, if not the colors of he silk. We could see no shape of any balloon and there was no obvious basket below the object for holding the people who would be operating the balloon.  He mentioned that he thought the light was flickering as a flame would. Just as he said this the flame flickered out and disappeared. We waited, thinking that if it were a balloon, the operator would have to re-ignite the flame to keep the balloon from falling. There were no sounds of attempts to re-ignite the flame and there was no more light. We could not see anything falling to the ground, even at a slow rate given for the hot air of a balloon to cool, bringing the balloon down. The sighting lasted about seven minutes. It was approximately 5:45pm, Wednesday, December 12, 2007, in the very Northwest corner of Washington State, about 30 minutes south of the Canadian border.

So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house. As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude. Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights. The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two ""star-like"" lights. I did not realize what I was watching until after the event. The two lights were traveling in a very straight path almost as if they were trying to elude the military helicopter, or possibly the helicopter was escorting them.

6,3,3,1 hour,"Multiple light phenomena witnessed in the sky above the Jamestown area of Williamsburg My two friends and I are very much involved in reading and learning about various UFO sightings around the world.  We keep up to date on these sightings and talk about the subject often.  Earlier in the evening, we had discussed what took place at the Surry powerplant just a week or two ago. During the early morning of June 3rd, 2008, My friend and I were out in the street observing what we believed to be either Venus or Jupiter (I can't remember which) in the South-Western sky through my telescope.  After observing for a short while, we began to joke around and just look at the stars. A few minutes later my friend alerted me to the sky directly overhead, where there was a faint moving object.  Upon inspection with my 10x50 binoculars, I was able to observe the object move smoothly across the sky, and then fade away.  It appeared to be very high, and shone like a dim star.  We have witnessed these objects in the past.  We decided to lay on the ground and look at the sky to see if anything else happened. We were both looking at the same area in the sky when a bright, but focused flash of light occurred, which we both observed.  I quickly inspected the area with my binoculars just in time to observe another object, this one a little brighter than the last.  It also faded away after a short period of around 20 seconds.  A few minutes later there was another flash in the same area of the sky (to the North East), but this time I was not able to observe an object. A short time later, we witnessed what I can only describe as a ""skipping"" bright light flashing across the sky.  The light flashed brightly for a moment while moving extremely fast across the sky.  It was not a meteorite, as the object flashed, and then flashed again further along its path, and then flashed 3 more times as it flew further away (from the southwest to the northeast).  It was at this point that my friend's brother (just inside the house nearby) called to see what we were doing outside.  We told him of the situation, and he came out quickly. No activity was present for a while, so we again observed Venus/Jupiter.  After a few minutes, I had a very strange urge to look at the sky.  I looked up to the north almost directly overhead and witnessed a bright spherical object, as bright as the brighter stars in the sky, moving to the south.  I observed it in the binoculars.  All 3 of us observed it as it crossed overhead.  At the moment it was nearly above us, the object's light increased greatly in intensity, at least 2 or 3 fold, until it was the brightest star in the sky, and then dimmed back out.  It was around for the longest duration of all of the objects, 30 seconds or more.  My friend and I were almost ecstatic at the sighting, as we had been waiting for something like this for quite a while. My friends and I are active observers of the sky.  We often sit out at night and watch for phenomena like these.  We have never witnessed anything like what we saw this evening.  We have witnessed a few faint objects before, but nothing conclusive.  These objects were unlike any others that we have seen in the night sky.  Interestingly enough, we often go out to the Colonial Parkway across from the Surry Powerplant to lay on the grass and observe the sky (we have witnessed objects in the sky there, but nothing like what was reported recently).  After the events of late, the sky is sure to get more attention around here. I hope this report proves interesting.  I will be keeping my eyes out for any new developments.  It seems that things are increasing in intensity here.  I appreciate this site greatly.  Thank you for maintaining it.","ufo with red, blue, white lights moving fast.

7,15,18,~3 minutes,"Orange Orb seen dancing over Roanoke Valley from Poor Mountain view; ~3 minutes Myself and four of my friends decided to go ""off-roading"" in my Jeep on some trails up Bent Mountain/Poor Mountain.  After driving down a few trails we got to a point where the trail goes along an overlook of the Roanoke Valley.  It was a clear day and a really nice view, so we decided to stop and hangout for a little bit.  We tossed some rocks around and chatted for a bit as we looked out over the valley.  We could see the Roanoke Airport and observed several planes taking off and landing during our time.  The Carilion Hospital was also in the distance and we watched as an emergency helicopter took off, and landed.  In short, we had a great view and a pretty good perspective of the area. As we watched, I suddenly noticed a bright orange orb hovering over the valley, near the airport.  I watched for a second trying to figure out what it was.  The orb started to ""dance"" in the sky.  It shot left, then back right, up a bit, back to the left.  It was moving incredibly fast compared to the planes we saw in the area.  I noticed two of my friends had stopped talking.  I asked the group if they were seeing what I was seeing.  The two who had stopped talking acknowledged that they were watching the same thing.  We began pointing it out to our other two friends and soon 4 out of 5 of us were watching this dancing orange orb in the sky.  We tried to reason that maybe it was a fighter jet doing aerial tricks, but the speed was so great compared to the other planes and it seemed to stop on a dime and change direction.  The orb stayed the same size during its maneuvers, so it wasn't getting any closer or farther from our position.  Just bobbing and dancing, shooting back a! nd forth. We watched as another plane landed at the airport, and had a good comparison on size and speed.  This object did not have the outline of a plane, just an orange orb that never changed shape.  The whole object glowed orange. As we were pointing it out to our fifth friend (he wasn't wearing his glasses), the object was now the furthest to the left of our view as it had been during our observation.  It then began slowly (more slowly than its previous speed) moving to the right in a straight line, going toward the only other mountain in our view of the valley (Roanoke Star Mountain).  Our fifth friend finally was able to see it (or so he said) as it went straight behind the mountain.  We waiting a few minutes, expecting it to come out from the other side of the mountain due to its trajectory, but it never did.  We waited and didn't see it again. It was starting to get dark, so we decided to head off the mountain.  As we talked about it, we all got chills reliving the experience.  We all also agreed that when we first started watching the orb, we got goose bumps and immediately knew what it was.  None of us had had any previous UFO experiences, yet we all felt we knew instantly what we were looking at without speaking to each other. This experience happened a while back, but I still remember it vividly and wanted to make record of it due to all the activity in the Roanoke area.  I plan to go back to Bent Mountain this summer sit and look out over the valley again.  Maybe I'll see the object again.  If nothing else, it is a spectacular view.

She called me out onto the porch to look at the night sky.  It had been a rainy day and cloudy night.  It was a dark but still somehow luminescent night of clouds.  In the far distance was a slit of fiery glow from the power plant on the other side of Lake Anna.  As I looked toward a dark corner of the sky, I noticed a dark wavering before a sea of luminescent clouds.  I felt as though I was seeing it track the movement of my friend so I thought it was her shadow.  But, I knew it was impossible for that to happen given the lack of light from the correct angle to cast it where it floated.  As that understanding was making its way into my conscious understanding,  I saw that my friend stood still but the dark wavering kept going.

7,19,21,3 minutes,"A cluster formation of red blinking lights, moving in various directions, until they blinked out was seen in the eastern sky. Our house is on high elevation in Lorton. We overlook the Mason Neck area. We can see everything from 1-95 freeway to South East Lorton, all the way out to the Potomac River.  Left to right in that line of sight are the areas of Ft. Belvoir Army Base, to Mason Neck/Woodbridge area on the right.  It's about a 5 mile distance to the river. Tonight was an overcast evening.  I was watching TV with my husband and I looked out the window that faces the river and saw what I thought was at first a reflection.  I kept staring at it, wondering why it looked like Christmas lights, because the roof of the house behind us isn't that high (and it was July!).  These red lights reflected in the mirror behind me as well. We both got up to check it out, went out on the deck and saw what appeared to be a formation of lights over the area of the Potomac River.  There must have been 2 dozen at first, and slowly as we watched, they all blinked off until there were none. The lights were red, sometimes white, all traveling left, right, and up (and sometimes slightly downward). Some blinked brightly, others stayed red.  I told my husband, I felt like I was looking at the milky way, but it was impossible because we never see more than a few stars at night around here, and with the overcast skies, it didn't make sense.  But that is what I could compare it to. I ran inside to get my phone and was able to get one picture. You can see about 9-12 lights above the roofline when I over-expose the image in photoshop.  I took 3 videos, only one slightly turned out.  It's totally black except towards the end of the less than a minute video, where you can see a few red lights.  I'm going to see if I can take it into my video software and lighten it up. After the lights went away, we watched an airplane fly in the same area, horizontally, right to left, then turn and fly right over our house.  I caught most of that on video as well.  We live near the flight path of Ft. Belvoir, but rarely do these planes fly at night, and they usually don't go over our house, but stay on the other side of 95. Coincidentally (?) police helicopters flew over our area for the 20 minutes afterwards that I was out and about.  That's not unusual, seeing as we live along the i-95 corridor, in the busy suburbs. I don't know what we saw. It could have been a wedding that released chinese lanterns. I've actually never seen those lanterns in the sky before, but there is NO breeze tonight at all.  It's hot and still and humid, so I don't know why they would be moving all over if they were lanterns. Just my opinion. We are both 42 year old professional people with a family.

1,3,19,15 minutes,"Spectacular Lights seen to separate in Virginia outside Washington DC At approximately 7:00pm on Saturday January 3 2009 my wife and I went into our backyard to walk our dogs.  We were in the backyard for a few minutes when I saw a bright light that seemed stationary in the Northeast sky.  I pointed the light out to my wife and than noticed it was slightly moving from north to south.  We live 40 miles outside Washington DC, near Dulles airport, so we do see a lot of airplane traffic.  I started to think we must be looking at a slow moving airplane.  As the light got closer I noticed there wasn't any blinking lights and this light was not acting like a conventional aircraft.  The light would slowly move than stop and stay stationary for several minutes than would start moving again.  While we watched the light I told my wife to stay and watch so I can go inside to grab the camera.  I ran into the house, grabbed the camera and opened the back sliding glass door. Just as I started filming the light was just making it over my house, I told my wife to meet me in the front yard. As I ran to the front yard and met my wife I again started filming the light, at this point it was slowly flying above Orion, which was just rising in the east. This is when the unbelievable happened. Just as the light was above Orions belt my wife said ""Look it's turning around"" I couldn't believe my eyes. The light was making a complete U-Turn. But even more spectacular, as the light made the U-Turn, another light continued moving south and stayed on the original path. What I'm trying to say is-the light we were originally watching turned into two separate lights. One made a complete 180 degree turn headed back north and was blue in color, the other light continued south. It seemed to me that these two lights were somehow together or connected and than separated. The light that U-Turned off the original light soon stopped and remained stationary for approximately five minutes as the other light continued south. Soon after the original light was out of sight the U-Turned light started moving ag! ain towa rds the north until it was out of sight.

7,20,0,45 min,"Multiple objects visible at miles over Chesapeake VA Near Cornland park I was dropping my girlfriend off at here house near the North Carolina boarder and saw a bright object in my peripheral vision. It was significant to me because of the magnitude of the object and its proximity to Jupiter, which was low to the horizon and getting ready to set for the night. This object was brighter than the star Vega, and varied in magnitude and color. I grabbed her attention when I noticed it was moving very fast and erratic. It appeared to have several multicolored lights and was flashing at an inconsistent pace. The object would do zig zag patterns and ascend and descend at a rapid pace. The most interesting thing is it almost never moved in a strait trajectory, and if its path seemed to be somewhat strait it would vary its speed, moving in a non fluid motion as if it was jerking. I know this was not the asteroid Vesta or comet C2006v13 due to the comet being near Draco and Vesta has not reached this kind of magnitude, and the motions that this object made do not follow modern conceptions of astrophysics. The most interesting thing is, as this object would decrease in magnitude to the point that It could not be seen there where 10 or more objects around and spread out across the horizon that would flash and get bright, these objects would then dimmer and the ""Main"" object would increase in magnitude. At times up to 4 different lights would be visible and would appear to triangle shaped and at times would appear to be cylindrical. This is hard to tell due to the fact that the object was at a great distance. At times you could see a flash of light that illuminate thin clouds near it and always seemed to be in the direction of other objects that you could see flash light at the main object.  Over the period of 45 minutes the object had moved from about 40 degrees altitude in the eastern south eastern horizon to about 15 degrees, back up to about 30 degrees. In our time of observation four lights were distinguishable, and multiple colours from white, blue, red, and green lights. The objects were still in the sky when I left to head home around 01:40. At that time I had a friend from California on the phone listening in on the event and trying to observer using the stars an Jupiter as a reference. He could not see anything telling me it was localized in nature and was within our atmosphere.  I am an amateur Astronomer and part of an Astronomy club that is a non profit educational group. This was unlike any event that I have ever seen. In astronomy we are very attentive to objects in the night sky and see some things that cannot be explained. Satellites and the ISS move fast and with a standard trajectory. This seemed to move with intelligence behind it, interact with other objects. This was the most significant thing I have ever seen in the night sky.  At its brightest point it would reach around A magnitude -1.0 and dim out to where it was not visible. Most of the time it would reach around a magnitude +1.0 . In some cases it would cover areas of around 30-40 arc minutes in a matter of seconds in a jerky motion, at times doing circles and ans S patterns in the sky.

After I was done mowing my neighbors lawn at 4:15 p.m., I went outside for a cigarette.  I decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky. The sun was shining behind some maple trees, decreasing its luminosity to the point where I was no longer blinded if I looked at it.  I could see bugs and pollen flying through the air, but I also saw something else as well.  Two metallic white / silver spheres caught the sun's light.  One proceeded to move North East, and I watched it fly to the horizon.  It seemed to have a sort of darkness around it, like a haze. The sky just seemed darker around it.  The other objects, still catching the suns light, hovered for a few more seconds and just vanished. I submitted the report to MUFON.  That day, another report was submitted by a man about how he and his wife and kids saw ""dozens"" of silvery spheres in Leesburg hovering in the sky over a Costco at about 5:00 PM, an hour after me.  They watched them for about a half hour, and saw some of them glow.  Their report also states that single spheres would split and become two, and two would become one.  They were moving North. Later that week another individual submitted a report to MUFON with pictures.  The individual saw a silvery white sphere flying North.  This report took place an hour or so before me in Richmond. That is three reports of silvery / white spheres in one day, over the course of a couple hours.  This is my report.  I don't know if the submitted theirs here or not but for investigation purposes, theirs and mine are on MUFON.  I am very sorry if NUFORC is a competitor of MUFON.  I just want to this story out to as many people as possible. The next day, somewhere between 4 - 4:15 PM I went out to the pipeline behind our house for another cigarette and in curiosity I looked up to sky at the spot where I saw the objects the day before.   My curiosity was peaked even more so because of a very low flying and very slow flying Blackhawk helicopter that flew over the pipeline.  I didn't think anything would come of it but I was wrong.  This time I watched a black sphere for a minute fly under one of the only clouds in the sky.  Once it hit the blue sky it was gone, like it could only be seen near the cloud.

I pulled off the highway and got out of my car to look at it without taking my eyes off the cars in front of me while driving. I was hoping other witnesses would soon join me as I continued to look up at this huge object in the sky, but cars just continued to speed by, apparently nobody else noticing what I was seeing or curious about why I was looking up at the sky. It was just after sunset, dark and yet clearly visible because it was so close and almost directly above me, lit by the city lights and the three round lights, where I pulled over and got out of my car.  I could hear no sound made by the object over the slight sound of many cars rushing past so close by to me. It continues to hover silently over me without moving, without blinking, without changing anything the entire time I observed it. After about maybe fifteen minutes of staring up at it, I gave up hoping someone else would witness it with me. I regretted not having my cell phone with me or I would have called police to see it. I didn't dare try to catch anyone's attention from the passing cars, fearful of causing an accident at those speeds if I tried to wave somebody down.  So I got in my car and went home, watching the news later for any mention of anyone else seeing a UFO like what I’d seen, but heard nothing so I never reported it.  I decided since it was so easy to see because of its size and location and so much traffic and so large a population directly underneath it in downtown Salt Lake City, I decided it must be something from our military since I didn’t see any military craft at all in the area, which is also by the way so close to the Salt Lake City airport that it must have shown on their radar so that’s why I assumed the airport radar people and local air force radar in Layton weren’t paying any attention to it, so that's why I decided nobody else was thinking it was extraterrestrial. However, it so happened that within the next year I happened to go out on one date with several men I met through internet dating sites who happened to work with top secret NASA or air force projects locally through a company called ATK (used to be Morton Thiokol) and another guy worked at area 51 before retiring whom I dated a few times, who gave me a copy of a video that shows him with a top secret aircraft before it became declassified (so I believe he knows top secret aircraft).  I told him about what I had seen and one other guy too, but they told me that our military has nothing like what I saw, ""nothing that big that can hover silently"". The one who worked at area 51 who is himself a pilot with his own airplane told me I might have seen something  called Aurora.  ""Sounds like you saw the Aurora but that is still classified.""   However, I have in the last day gone online and viewed photos of hundreds of triangular shaped crafts and the photos of so-called Aurora and I have seen nothing that looks like what I saw, except for other triangular-shaped craft with a round light in each corner, but none of those look like what I saw.  What I saw, I’m also sure is NOT the TR-3B because the top of what I saw is so very different from all internet photos of the TR-3B I've browsed.  I don’t recall any light in the center of ""my"" triangle either.  I also don't remember ""my"" triangle having rounded corners, but sharper corners from the TR-3B images online and it was more equilateral triangle than the Aurora photos online, much less aerodynamically stream-lined on top than Aurora photos. I am embarrassed to say that I never wrote down the date of this incident, thinking I would never forget it, but unfortunately I have forgotten even the year of this sighting.  To fill out this form, I was required to estimate and exact date but I do not know at all the date within a period of a few years nor even the exact season or time except that it was well dark and it was warm enough outside that I don’t recall feeling cold while I watched outside my car, and I remember clear roads all the way on my drive home from visiting friends in Ogden that evening, coming into Salt Lake City just as night was falling.  I cannot believe that no one else saw it because it was so huge and there hovering in one place for so long in great clear weather!  So that's why I'm trying to find out if anyone else saw it that night, to help me figure out what the exact date was.  I’m certain that the date of my sighting was after Spring of 2004 because I know I was divorced when I saw it.  I know I saw it at least three years ago.  That’s all I can say for sure.

But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn't. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky. I had to return my attention to driving again but when I returned my gaze, thinking the unidentified object was probably gone, it was still there. This charade lasted about five minutes. I literally blinked and it had vanished. I searched around the sky as thoroughly I could but it was nowhere to be seen.","Two very slow moving ""stars"" seen well past sunrise.",GLENDALE,UT,CIRCLE,2007,-1.002487858,2.365914222,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,0.141025804,0,0,NA,1.105439476,0,-2.349040764,0,NA,SSW,PARTLY CLOUDY
7,14,10,6 minutes,"Shiny Metal Object Defies Laws of Physics, Then Shoots Off Into the Sky. 4 witnesses. I am of sound mind and testify in open court on a regular basis.  I have three college degrees: a BA in History, a BA in Philosophy and a Juris Doctor degree.  I do not drink, do not use drugs and honestly have withheld this information along with my three friends who were with me at the time.  None of us are on medications or have any history of psychosis or psychotic episodes.  We were all working on a construction project at the time of the sighting.  It occurred as follows:   On July 14th of 2012 we drove out to the Moore Cut Off road in order to construct a cattle abatement/antelope crossing fence.  I remember the date because I had lived in France in 2002-2003 and was explaining to my coworkers about Bastille Day.   We started stretching wire and tying it to the t-posts around 8:30 am.  We approached a hill which had very large rocks jutting out of the side.  We all grouped together and a friend asked what time it was,  I checked my phone and saw that it was 10:38.  I remember this because we always guessed what time it was before looking and the closest person to the correct time was paid a dollar by the other coworkers.   I then glanced up at the full moon which was declining in the western sky.  I am an avid amateur astronomer and was marveling at the moon's position so late in the morning.  I then saw a shiny metallic shape located under the moon.  I quickly drew attention to it and asked one of my coworkers (who was attending aviation school) what type of plane it was.  He stated ""that's no plane I've ever seen.""  Given our relative closeness to Area 51 (it's all desert from where we were to Area 51, hundreds of miles of nothing) we just chalked it up to some sort of new type of secret air craft that was classified.   So we sat down to watch it, but it was simply hovering in the same spot.   Then, in the blink of an eye, it darted across the sky.  I cannot begin to calculate the distance it covered, but my pilot friend said that there is no plane in existence that could travel that fast from a dead stop.   We then started to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft, not even a secret air craft.  As we looked around the sky, we saw other aircraft flying east and south.  Each craft was moving extremely slowly compared to the object and they all had a trail behind them. There was no trail behind the object. We watched the object as it hovered in the new location across the sky (to the north) of where the moon was positioned.  I told my friends to expect a sonic boom, but no sound came.  It then darted right back to the EXACT same position it had been under the moon.  This time it zig-zagged down going first to the right and then to the left, but it seemed to be moving downward away from the moon.  After 5 or 6 zig zags it stopped and then blasted straight up into the sky. It went in front of the moon and that's when I got the best glimpse of the object. It was gone.  I said to my friends ""please tell me you guys saw that...  That was the craziest thing I have ever seen.""  They all agreed that they had seen the exact same thing.  I looked down at my phone to call my father (who works for the government) but I didn't have cell service.  8 minutes had passed and we all sat there for a while, dumbfounded at what we had seen and experienced. I am not saying that this was an alien aircraft or extra terrestrial life.  I will not presume to make such an assumption.  However, I do know that this thing moved unlike any aircraft we publicly know about to this day.  The amount of g-forces that this type of maneuvering would create would literally kill those pilots without some sort of advanced technology to mitigate the pressure.   I know what I saw though and all 3 of the other witnesses saw the same exact thing.  We still discuss it to this day when we all get together.","UFO checks out abnormal heat source,thinking it could be a heat vent.",FERRON,UT,OVAL,2012,0.243405395,0.353258622,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,0.746124336,0,0,-0.055151095,-0.911239024,0,0.695133195,0,NA,NORTH,LIGHT RAIN

9,18,20,3 minutes,"Red, circular object floating above Alpine, Utah...STRANGE! Our children were playing outside in the front yard while the adults were talking inside the home (birthday party for one of the adults). Suddenly around 8:15pm (at dusk) all the children ran through the door yelling for us to come out. My brother-in-law and I went outside to see what all the commotion was about and all the kids were pointing toward the mountain and the sky. As I looked in the direction of where they were pointing, I clearly saw a tiny, reddish/orangish, circular object slowly floating away from the half way point of the mountain and into the sky (with NO noise whatsoever). The object continued up until it hit about 1,500 feet (no way to really tell how high) and then nearly stopped and moved horizontal to the left about 200 feet. Then it STOPPED! And for about 4 seconds in twinkled almost like a star, and then POOF it was gone! STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST!!!  I then quizzed my son, 13 years old, about what he saw. He said that initially when he saw the light it was larger then when I saw it and it was ON the mountain's half way point, and in his words, ""Dad, I thought it was a campfire."" He said, that the ""campfire"" just lifted off the mountain and started to float up. Again, STRANGE!  After we talked about it for about 30 minutes, my brother-in-law decided to call the police. They came to the home in about 15 minutes and we gave a full report...and they mentioned that no one else had called it in. It was funny because one of the officers was on his first day on the job!  To be clear, there are NO homes, structures, or any man made things at the half way point of this mountain...just pure mountain, and no trees...just shrub oak. There is no way that it was a plane, helicopter, balloon, model rocket, laser beam, etc...at least not by my observation.

6,5,14,30 min,"Unexplained objects in broad daylight over Victoria, TX. On the afternoon of June 5, 2009, my wife, daughter, son and I witnessed some unexplainable activity in the sky above Victoria, TX.  We were swimming in the pool at my mom and dad’s house when I noticed what we first thought looked like a balloon lifting across the sky at a distance to the north -northeast.  I watched the object track across the sky for a couple of minutes, and then noticed a second object, and then a third tracking behind the first object on a similar trajectory.  I was ready to dismiss them as released balloons of some sort until all three of the objects began to flash and then switched directions and began circling back toward the direction they came from.  It was then that I became very interested in what we were witnessing.  The objects were barely visible against the blue sky, but were much easier to see with my polarized sunglasses. My son and my daughter were able to see the objects with their naked eye.  My wife had to put on my sunglasses to see them. The objects were joined by two others and they began to rotate in a circular pattern.  It was then that I noticed another object that appeared fixed in the sky at a higher altitude and these objects appeared to be rotating in a pattern beneath the stationary object.  As I was watching this happen, I noticed what appeared to be two military jets at extremely high altitude circling the area in a much wider pattern.  It then occurred to me that maybe they were looking for these objects.  My wife suggested that maybe it was some sort of training exercise.  When the jets turned back to the northeast, all of the circulating flashing objects began to disappear one-by-one.  The stationary object remained and I watched it stay in this same position for at least another 10 minutes.  The object then began to drift slowly to the east – southeast and looked like it was also getting farther away as it became much harder to see.  The object then stopped and remained stationary As I continued watching the object, I saw the two military jets again.  They were travelling on the same flight path, but were much farther apart than before.  They followed a similar path as they had earlier but appeared to be much higher and slower.  I then spotted a third jet that was on a different path and appeared to be heading more in the direction of the stationary object. .  I sent my wife out to my truck to get my digital camera so I could attempt to get some shots of the object before it moved out of sight.  I took several pictures, but it was impossible to see the object in the screen on the camera.  The stationary object then began to move very slowly and then vanished from sight. By this time I was pretty worked up and was scanning the sky for more activity.  I was about to give up when just over the roof of the house, again to the north-northeast , I saw two more objects moving across the sky.  One was flashing, and one was solid.  The flashing one disappeared rather quickly, so I continued to watch the solid one.  It moved across the sky in a similar manner to the previous one.  I tried taking several more pictures, and then I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was probably about 5 minutes. The only way I can describe what we saw is that the solid objects looked similar to what a satellite would look like moving across the night sky (except for the stopping and changing directions) and the flashing objects looked like what something flat and reflective spinning in the wind would look like as it reflected the sun.  I am truly amazed and mystified.  I wish there was a way I could find out where the jets came from and what they were doing there.   I feel very strongly that they were looking at the same thing I was. I am going to download the photos from my camera as soon as I finish this and see if there is anything there.

We spotted two star like lights that followed us all the way back to Texas City.  No matter which road we took or turned onto the two lights were following us.  We sat in the car for about 25 minutes until about midnight talking about what we had experienced.  The sun roof of my friends Dodge Shadow was open.  We were listening to a talk show about UFO's coincidentally at the time of all this that night.  I looked up and saw a very bright metallic looking saucer shaped craft. It made no sound whatsoever at all.  It seemed to float and was descending over us at about a 45 degree angle. It looked to be about 40' in diameter, and was no more than 20 or 30 feet over head.  I was so astonished, I could not even tell my friend who had driven us to where we had parked across the street from my moms home what I had seen.  My friend was looking forward and did not see what I had seen.  When I called out to my friend his name, he looked over at me and acknowledged. I was trying to get him to look up, but it was too late. I caught out of the corner of my eyes the last bit of the saucer descending over the tree tops in the yard of my moms next door neighbors house. I finally regained my composure enough to tell my friend what I had seen.  I told him that he would not believe me.   He replied to me the following:  ""You are not going to believe what I just saw.  Then he explained that he saw what appeared to have been a flying saucer that headed straight towards us.  It hovered in front of the car, and was also dead silent. It then made an astonishing maneuver and went straight up at an incredible rate of speed.  I told my friend that what we had just witnessed had to be the two points of light that resembled stars, that had followed up all the way from League City.  He told me that we should make a report of what we had witnessed. I told him th! at no one would believe us. I told him that they might want to! have ou r heads examined, and that we did not have any actual proof to confirm what we had seen.  I was not going to go exploring the neighbors back yard in fear of what the apparent Dennison from another world might decide to do to us.

6,27,21,1+ hour,"Numerous lights frequently orbit our area. To begin, described below is a brief scenario we three have endured silently for years now. For my wife, and our son... all of us diligent witnesses to aerial oddities. My wife first noticed what appeared to be a single, irregularly large, star or similarly bright object due west, possibly one thousand feet in the sky.  Approximately four discernible colors were observed, while rapidly darting south and west across the sky. Originating location, to be more precise, could be approximated somewhere between Commerce and Sulphur Springs on HWY 11.  The first object was stationary on the horizon from our location near the Lake Sulphur Springs public boat slip sitting on FM 2285. Once observed for approximately fifteen minutes, the initial object appeared to wobble gently on it's axis, then began a pattern of moments, with extreme precision, positioning itself in a variety of geometric shapes. After reaching a stationary formation again, still in the same general location, the colors began pulsing between red, blue, and an indistinguishable yellow/white/orange glow.  The object shot northerly toward what I imagine is around Commerce.  At this moment two additional lights faded into view as if they were perhaps cloaked in the current position.  The three lights simultaneously and in succession appeared to resume formation with the primary object performing the same sort of initial choreographed maneuvers. After two to three minutes one object faded out of view while the two others still danced in almost direct view of the soft glow of, again, what I suspect to be, the city of Commerce. The additional two lights moved approximately thirty to fifty yards back and forth from their northerly position south, then back again.  After performing this maneuver for several moments, these two objects reached a fixed location and appeared to be pulsating. While fading in and out of the aforementioned color scheme, both objects together, dimmed and faded out of view. Almost directly overhead, more northerly, a single light faded into view but appeared as an ethereal looking soft white ... Similar to a star, but discernible by the naked eye.  The object was travelling at a high rate of speed, heading from an approximated due north to the East, toward the Texarkana area.  Upon reaching this easterly position, two additional lights intercepted the object and took a triangular formation. We all watched as these objects pulsed various lights, primarily red and blue, then upon settling on a fixed location, somewhere around three times the rate of speed most airplanes travel across the sky, either shoot out of visibility...  Upward...  Not toward the horizon, or disappeared out of view entirely. Again visually scanning the northern sky, we saw what appeared to be a somewhat irregularly bright star. Hovering in a fixed position, glowing white, the object emanated a reddish orange glow then exhibited a red burst three to give times it's original size and disappeared from view. These are frequent sightings for the three of us. We are healthy, educated, and responsible members of society. Our child, family, and occasional family friends have also witnessed these baffling lights. Typically, we have seen these lights first noticeable across our western horizon just after sunset, immediately following the colors of twilight fading to dark. Animals in the area will typically begin stirring, coyotes howl, dogs bark aggressively, birds and insects such as cicadas cease to make noise... all immediate prior to a sighting nearby. There have been well over ten obviously distinguishable lights sighted moving faster than any common aircraft, just tonight. How this has not made the local news is beyond me.  I am former US Army Ranger, law enforcement, and definitely keen on protecting our anonymity.  Perhaps similarly security conscious individuals or those with a respect for their own public reputations viewing this type of anomaly can speak to the ""why"" of the matter. Words, and especially our attempted video or photo documentation, do no justice to the events I am poorly attempting to describe. Similar occurrences in this area (google search) are recorded as far back as the 1940s. I hope that one day this may be of some benefit... to someone. Good luck.

7,10,23,25-30 seconds,"Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed! I had stepped outside onto my back 2nd story porch for a cigarette and stood and admired the sky and stars as I do everynight. A particularly bright object that appeared to be a star or planet caught my attention and I proceeded to stare at it. The object was stationairy and appeared no different looking than a bright star so I quickly dimissed it. The object was stationairy from the time I came out onto the porch and first noticed it (10-15 seconds). The object was directly East of my location and situated high in the sky, about 25-30 degrees off of being directly vertical over me and at a 70-75 degree angle in the sky off the horizon. I was about to look away and stare at another patch of sky when I noticed that the object started moving to the North. It moved slowly and at a constant speed in a straight line at a constant altitude, which made me think that maybe it was an airplane coming to or from DFW airport which is very close. But the object appeared to be at very high altitude, higher than I've ever seen a plane fly, and as I scrutinized it I could not see any blinking lights that distinguish aircraft and are usually visible at any altitude. The object was a solid and constant sphere shaped light that again looked similar to a bright star. It quickly became obvious it was NOT an airplane but I still didn't think UFO. So then I start thinking I'm seeing a satellite or something go overhead in orbit. I continue observing the object move East to North across the sky expecting to watch it (thinking its a satellite) arch across the sky. But after 8-10 seconds of slow moving predictable flight the object began to move erraticly and looked to be gaining altitude because the object was getting dimmer and dimmer the higher and further away it got from me. The object also began to accellerate, slowly at first while it zigzagged but then it really started picking up speed! I mean at the high altitude the object was at, for it to move that fast across the sky it must've been doing incredible speed. I have never seen something accellerate so fast! As the object accellerated it climbed near vertical and, well, ""ascended into space"" is the best way I could describe it. It did NOT continue travelling across the sky, it accellerated to unbelievable speed and went near vertical and appeared to rapidly climb out of the atmosphere. IT DID NOT just disappear behind some trees or over the horizon, it went near straight UP and disappeared overhead as it accellerated away! When I saw the object start to move like gravity didn't effect it, and move as unbeilveably fast as it did, an icy ball materialized in my stomach, and I felt genuine fear rush over ! me like a wave, when it became obvious that this could not possibly be a plane or satellite. I saw it, it's real! Total event time 25-30 seconds from the time I came onto the porch and witnessed the object stationairy (10-15 secs) start to move slowly (8-10 secs) and then zigzag, climb, and accelerate upward near vertical until out of sight overhead (3-5 secs).

We ran back home scared and it's almost as if it followed us. We looked over head and it's almost as if it slowed down, not like any plane can do but rather fast. Then we both saw it overhead and it looked like some type of plane but with a triangular shaped ""torso"". It took off very fast and had basically no noise whatsoever.

The second photo shows a UFO in the upper center and ""cookie cutter"" type hole the cloud, in the same size and shape of the UFO, and a second UFO now emerged from behind a tree in the bottom right quadrant of the photo. If you look at the photos closely, there are also some smaller, lighter grey dots that are hovering in an arc--possibly circular formation--around the UFO in the top center of the first two photos. This was not something on my windshield or camera.  If you enlarge the photos, in one image, you can see the overhead powerline in front of the UFO and the tree in front of the second UFO. Again, I didn't know I had photographed anything until hours later. I am willing to share additional photos, if you need them, taken before and after the photos that show the UFOs.  I am also willing to discuss the circumstances under which I took the photos and answer any questions that you might have.","Two Orb-Shaped UFOs Spotted Over North Bend, OR",SAN ANTONIO,TX,SPHERE,2014,-1.828711804,1.609891306,0,0.13028168,NA,0,0.0642725,1.078928529,0,0,NA,1.283381697,0,-0.874519003,0,-0.118712472,SE,MOSTLY CLOUDY

This is the first time we have ever seen a ufo.  I was driving my wife to work on Loop 1604 West in San Antonio Texas, Sunday July 27, 2008 at about 13:10. I was driving and she was looking outside the passenger window.  The sky was blue, no clouds in the sky, very sunny. She said she had seen this object  flying to her right, about 200 feet up.  She said she watched it for about a minute before she realized she didn’t know what it was and told me to look at it.  It was hard to see at first because it was sliver and was like a flat egg, it blended in so easily to the sky but I did finally see it and we watched it accelerate to a very fast pace and then slow down again, at this point it was in front of us, over the freeway.  Then it continued a steady pace to our left, and landed.  It went straight down to land, not like an airplane.   I wanted to exit and look for it but my wife did not want to. So we drove on.  It was not a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  We did not see any markings on it.  We did not take any pictures with our phones, when it was happening we were in such disbelief that we didn’t even think of takings pictures of it.  This happened before the 281 highway exit on 1604, it landed behind a Shopping center.

2,24,15,5 minutes,"Guitar Pick shaped UFO Flies Over Houses In San Antonio Subdivision My wife with brother and I were sitting outside on our patio deck when I noticed something I thought might have been a floating bag drifting over from the direction of our neighbors house toward us. I pointed it out to my wife and made a joking comment about it being a UFO as she is a serious skeptic on the subject. My brother and I started discussing how the object was at a high altitude for it being a plastic bag and discussed the physics behind the strength of the wind needed for it to stay aloft. As we  we discussing this, the object made a lazy L-shaped U-turn toward the house behind us. It was at this point that both my brother and my wife noticed that the object had a ""guitar-pick"" shape and was not a plastic bag. I also noticed that the object was rocking back and forth on its axis in a slow wobble. We stood motionless watching the object as it continued toward the street in front of the house behind ours. I would approximate its altitude at being between 50-100 feet from the ground. Its length was 3-5 feet and had almost no width that I could see, making it extremely flat. The objects color was very white with no lights or moving parts seen. It made no sound that we could hear. When it reached the next street behind our house it started to gain altitude steadily. We could not begin to guess the speed at which it rose but it must have been extremely fast because it reached a very high altitude in around 30 seconds. At some point before we lost sight of it in the sky, I noticed that there was a tiny white round object that had seemingly materialized from the sky and flew very close to the ""guitar-pick"". I mentioned this to my brother who then stated that I must have been staring too long at the sky and was seeing a reflection of the light. I stood close to him and pointed the object out. He grew excited as he saw another white orb streak by the ""guitar-pick"". My wife suddenly pointed out yet another one moving in the opposite direction the other 2 had taken. These white orbs were moving at speeds that were impossibly fast and seemed to orbit the ""guitar-pick"" in motion. The ""guitar-pick"" at this time was almost out of visual range but looked as if it was still gaining in altitude. There were no other aircraft in the sky that day. There are sometimes military aircraft in the vicinity but as it was a Sunday very few if any were flying.

We kept our eyes trained on it as it descended.  Strangely enough, it appeared to get lower and lower the more we acknowledged it's presence.   As it continued to descend we recognized it to be a triangular metallic craft having 3 white lights affixed to each of its corners.  And here is where it gets really bizarre.   The craft continued to lose more and more altitude until it was eventually about 500 ,or less, feet above us.  It was DEFINITELY aware of our presence, and was at this altitude to, seemingly, get a closer view of us.  The natural outdoor lighting around this time wasn't optimal, so scant details of the craft's exterior were acquired. We could however make out that it was metallic.  The craft's lights were jarringly bright. It hovered, silently, above us at this altitude for about a minute and then silently disappeared( for lack of a better word).!  The craft exited at an out-of-this-world speed into the Northeastern sky.  We have seen strange lights in the corn-field behind our house for years, but no experience can equate to this encounter.

I was in the pool at my friends house in Plano , Texas.  I looked up into the sky looking east and noticed a tiny pulsing REDish Gold spec of light in the air.  It was moving northward very slowly. The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length. I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did. When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north... Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone.

As I inspected the light I noticed that it was too high up to be a plane around Dallas (my house is right underneath the regular flight patterns for incoming planes into Love Field and DFW Airports) and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.   I thought it might have been a satellite due to the size of the light and the steady speed, but after 10 seconds the brightness swelled (not like a flash, but like someone manually changing the intensity of an indoor LED light) and dimmed back down, with the light beginning moving in a small zigzag or spiral pattern before it disappeared.

7,12,21,5-8 seconds,"Bright red, yellow and white round light, hazy, long yellow tail, high rate of speed, observed by Police Officer, S of Houston, TX.. Date: 07/12/2014 Time:2105 hrs Duration: 5-8 seconds Sighting city: Pearland Sighting state: Texas Zip: 77581 County: Brazoria County Witness: 1 Shape: Round and hazy, possibly a cluster. Number: 1 or 3 grouped together. Description: Round, hazy, red, white and yellow, bright lights with a long tail, extremely high rate of speed. I reside in a suburb located about 20 miles south of Houston, Texas.  There is quite a bit of light pollution in my area, coming from Houston to the north, and a small baseball field to the east, so star gazing is minimal.  There is a small, private airport, about 3/4 mile SW of my location.  Approximately 5 miles NE is Ellington Field, a former AFB, and still a current NASA facility.  My neighborhood is full of trees, which partially obscured my vision of what I have just seen. At 2105 hrs, I was in my front yard, speaking with a family member on my phone, facing north.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the sky, and turned to see what it was.   I observed a multi-colored, red, yellow and white, brightly lit object, moving at a ridiculously high rate of speed, coming from the SE, and traveling almost due NW, or right to left for me.  This object had a long tail, similar to a comet or shooting star, that was a sort of a fuzzy, faint yellow.  The lights were not blinking, bright, yet hazy, like it was surrounded by part of the front part of the tail..   The angle of elevation was somewhere between 45 and 60 degrees.  I couldn’t say if this object was at 35,000 feet, or skimming the treetops of the houses across the street.   When I first saw the object, it was NE from my house, and as I was trying to tell my family member what I had just seen, and running out into the street to get a better look, the object continued on its NW course, dis! appearing over the horizon.   This object was in my view for a very short time, somewhere between 5 and 8 seconds.   From my perspective, this object appeared to be about the size of a basketball.   There was no noise coming from the object, but every dog in the neighborhood was  barking or howling at something that I couldn’t hear. I am an active, 25 year Police Officer, and have never seen anything so strange, or move so fast.  I am not one to believe in alien spacecraft, much less report on one, but what I saw doesn’t compute with anything I know, and I would really like to know what the hell I just saw..",Triangular  Object,PEARLAND,TX,LIGHT,2014,0.177832066,1.374911211,0,-0.00609496,NA,0,0.0642725,1.472242576,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,0.124350578,0,NA,SOUTH,CLEAR
5,12,15,8-10 seconds,"Fast-moving, circular, white object observed for 8-10 seconds--day time sighting On the above time, date & location, I observed a very small, white, circular craft almost directly above me--looking straight up in the sky.  This object was traveling almost directly north with about a 10-30 degree westerly direction, (using a 360 degree compass).  The object traveled two (2) times faster than a satellite; possibly three (3) times faster than a satellite.  This craft traveled in a straight line for 8-10 seconds & then faded out.  I did not hear any sound at all from this craft.  It is extremely difficult for me to determine the altitude of this object, which as I think about it, is truly another odd characteristic of this craft.  (I will explain this comment further in the text).  The sky was 100% cloudless, very clear, and a beautiful day that everyone was commenting about.  The temperature was about 78 degrees with calm winds & moderate to low humidity.  I was getting my car washed, and was walking my dog and looking up at the sky when I observed this craft.  (I had a video camera in the trunk of my car, but this object was moving so quickly, there was absolutely no time to go back for it).  Holding my hand straight out, my thumb would easily cover this craft.  The best description on size I could think of was that this craft was about the same size as a very high flying plane that you can just make out on an extremely clear day, maybe a plane at 30,000-40,000 feet or so.  In other words, a plane that you CAN completely make out, but is absolutely tiny as seen with the naked eye because its altitude is so high.  With this said, it should be understood that I have been a plane fanatic since I was small child.  It should also be understood I enjoy looking for and watching night time satellites & have easily seen 100 in my life.  (Out in the country on one night, I observed eight satellites in a 2-3 hour time period, I know what satellites look like).  I have grown up close to a major civilian airport, and also around a military airport.  I can easily estimate the altitude of just about any plane or helicopter with relative accuracy.  But with this object, I am having a real problem with even attempting to guess its altitude to an almost frustrating degree.  I do not understand this.  My best guess is that this object was at an altitude of 10,000 to 40,000 feet.  I am leaning toward roughly 30,000 feet.  I will say that I do not believe it was any lower than approximately 10,000 feet.  I have no idea how large this circular craft was.  However, this craft looked remarkably similar to the craft seen in the videos that are repeatedly taped in Mexico.  I am speaking of the dozens of white (apparently circular) craft that fly together usually in formation, sometimes in, ""swarms.""  The craft I saw looked like one of these craft, but at an apparently higher altitude and moving much faster than most of the videos I have seen of similar craft.  I will say that this thing was really moving; it had to be going at least 4,000 mph or much faster depending on its altitude.  No sonic boom, no sound at all.  I should add that I was wearing sunglasses.  The brand name of these sunglasses is, ""Costa Del Mar.""  I paid about $140 dollars for these about seven years ago.  What distinguishes these sunglasses from the corner store sunglasses is the coating.  Without getting technical, these sunglasses make objects extremely vivid & clear as compared to any other sunglasses I have ever owned or come across.  (These sunglasses are actually fisherman’s sunglasses, although I do not fish).  When I first purchased them, I was amazed how vivid & clear birds & planes appeared.  My point is that, with the exceptionally clear weather, together with my 20/20 vision, and the added clarity of these sunglasses, I was able to determine this craft’s shape.  This object was not glowing white, no lights, no pulsing.  It was simply a clear, vivid white.  Besides my inability to determine the objects altitude & size, another odd characteristic was its movement.  I would not describe it as flying, but as gliding. This is simply my perspective.  I do not believe this was a daytime satellite.  The reason I do not believe this was a satellite was that I could make out this craft’s shape which was, although tiny, clearly round.  A second reason I do not believe this was a satellite was because this thing was moving faster than any object I have ever seen in my life; two to three times faster than any satellite.  With that said, and to be completely objective, I do not recall observing a day time satellite--only early morning or late evening satellites.  So if it was a day time satellite, why was it clearly round, and why was it moving so fast?  I am in my mid thirties, and have never seen a UFO in my life.  And it is not for lack of trying; I am constantly sky watching.  I have no idea what this object may have been except a UFO. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear ((name and title deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  You seem to us to be an excellent witness, and you compose prose unusually well, which is something we observe here only rarely. Did the object generate a contrail, please?  Also, was its shape similar to any type of aircraft that you can imagine?  For example, if it had wings, were they swept back, or similar to a delta-winged aircraft, perhaps.  Also, do you have any idea why the object faded from view?  It seems unusual that the object disappeared from view, given that you sighted it during daytime.   Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center, and for taking the time to compose such a nice report.  We will be posting newly received reports tomorrow, and yours will be among them.  By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.  Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it.  Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center Seattle, WA Hotline:  (206) 722-3000 (8:00 a.m. to midnight)   ((END MESSAGE)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Thank you, I have a ((deleted--degree)) in ((deleted--writing)) although my regard for the media is abhorrent at best. No, absolutely no contrail whatsoever.  (And there were no contrails in the sky that I noticed as well). Its shape was not similar to any aircraft I have ever seen including the alleged Aurora.  I have been to a few air shows, and pride myself on distinguishing most military aircraft & have done so since I was in 7th grade. No wings, no swept back wings like the F-14.  Not delta-winged.  This object was clearly circular in shape.  Yes, I failed to answer this in my report & knew while I was writing it that this was not clearly stated.  I do not know why it faded from my view.  Perhaps this object was much higher than 40,000 feet.  In layman’s terms, if 12 O’clock is straight up, I observed this object at about 12:30 and, ""lost"" it at about roughly 2 O’clock.   It was moving.  Possibly it was in the atmosphere.  I just cannot answer this.  I will say that this object, this craft, was indeed difficult to see & perhaps I just lost sight of it.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that it was at 30,000 to 40,000 feet, a tiny 30 foot disc, and I just lost sight of it.  You are welcome.  Thank you for all you have done.  By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.   Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it.  Ok, at about 10 pm to 10:15 pm, I was walking my dog & listening to my ((deleted)) on my cell phone.  I looked up at the stars as I always do.  I noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  It caught my eye for just a second or two, I believe because it may have been moving, I am not sure, and I looked back down.  (Just a normal bright star).  I looked up maybe five seconds later and this, ""star,"" was gone and that really caught my attention.  So I carefully watched the sky roughly where this, ""star,"" had been, and then noticed a typical looking satellite, a satellite that has, ""dimmed,"" after not being lit up by the sun, but is clearly visible.  (It was traveling north).  I only saw this apparent satellite after it had, ""dimmed,"" for a couple of seconds before it clearly disappeared from my view.  This ""dimmed"" satellite moved at the speed as per normal for all satellites I have observed.  As I was still looking up at the sky, I then noticed a very dimly lit V-shaped formation of maybe 8 to 10, ""birds"" (?) moving north/north-east.  If these were birds, they kept one hell of a tight formation.  I lost these, ""birds"" within a few seconds.   I have NEVER seen anything that I considered could possibly be a UFO until I submitted my report.  I was literally typing the report when my ((deleted)) called & ((deleted))  So I walked my dog.  The first object was probably a satellite, the second object very possible birds.  But the second object was simply odd because this formation was so tight and literally kept perfect formation.  It truly looked like the typical V-shaped formation that has so often been seen.  This was so weird that I could not bring myself to submit a second report--in the middle of my first UFO sighting/report of my life; I walk outside and see this.  But after the two sightings you mentioned I felt I should at least mention this.  Again, this is so odd, that I never would have mentioned this had you not mentioned these sightings.  Please understand this information is absolutely true, absolutely sincere, and not a joke in any form.  I do not know what else to say.

9,9,17,8 minutes,"Red oval with black dot and white inverted V directly underneath which may have been a trail. Between September 1st & 14th, 2008 (can’t remember exact the date though it wouldn’t have been a Monday or Wednesday) my grandson, 12 years old and a straight A student currently in the sixth grade and I, a 53-year-old business owner, were about to turn into my driveway in Palestine, TX between 4-7PM.  It was a clear day, very few clouds, and the sun was not in our line of vision.     I was headed due north and we saw an object coming from the northwest or about 10:00 going upward from the tree line …We thought at first it might be a jet or weather balloon but it had an upside down white V shape coming from underneath and the shape did not vary or leave a “print” in the sky like a jet and a balloon is usually like an upside down teardrop and clear. As we watched, it came directly over us, moving steadily and seeming lower than it first appeared to be and moving toward the southeast or 5:00 direction. When it was over us we both thought it looked like an upside down lady bug in both it’s shape and as it was red with a black area like a dot on it and the “V” was still very clearly visible and exactly the same.  The bottom of the “V” never varied in its length. The V was thicker or wider, right under the object and seemed to come to a point on each “leg” of the “V”.   We had the windows down and I turned the car off but we didn’t hear any noise. The trees in the yard started to block our view as it moved through the sky somewhat behind us so I started the car, did a quick 3 point turn in the driveway and moved to the end of our little road, about 200 yards.  The object was totally gone. I usually don’t think much about this sort of thing as we live close to the balloon base but I checked the calendar that night and there were no scheduled launched.  I was very peculiar to us in that it was red and the white “V” was so stable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Last night after having a fun time of dinner and conversation with 2 of my friends I headed home.  It was 9:25 PM, when I slowed to make a 90 degree turn onto the road where my house is.  I happened to look up into the sky, a very clear space above the road at that point with no trees blocking the view, and there were no clouds, and as I gazed briefly, I slammed on the brakes (I was only doing about 25 mph to turn) because a star like bright light just popped into existence.  It looked like a magical appearance. All of this happened very quickly, and I thought, “Hell it’s them!” but then I thought “maybe it’s a comet, or a shooting star?  But it was sitting still, and it had no tail.

So in about 2 or 3 seconds, it appeared, stayed there a second, then shot across the sky and instantly vanished.  It didn’t disappear behind clouds or trees. It was in wide open sky.

Just one bright light and another bright light. At first they sort of resembled stars, but way brighter. So I looked around it was pretty bright out when these two lights were in the sky, and there were absolutely no stars in the sky. But I still thought maybe they were stars or planets maybe glowing in the sky from the sun. I eventually watched these two objects until the sun started to set. This is where I could determine if these two objects were. As I saw this I realized this was unique, a maybe once in a lifetime chance to see something like this. So I grab my cellphone for my camera because my actual came! ra is broken, and I took two pictures along with a video.

At the speed the ORB was traveling, I expected by the time I reacted and turned my head left that it would have been well beyond the Northern horizon. Once I located the actual position of the ORB, I was astonished to see that it had not shot out of view, but had stopped accelerating just after it crossed over RM.1431.  But that's not all.....The Hi-Speed, Low Altitude ORB I witnessed had now become 2 ORBs and were in a 'wild dance' in the sky about 100'-150' to the north of RM.1431. As if the 2 ORBs were putting on a show for me, the lights went into a highly energetic, highly reactive state of movement that looked like a couple of Tasmanian Devils do the Tango.  The 2 ORBs spun around each other, twisted, tied and twirled in a relatively tight area with one another for about 2 seconds and disappeared.  I did not see how the 1 ORB became 2 ORBs.  It could have split into 2, or perhaps paired up with another ORB not in my awareness... This is the best description I can offer of what I witnessed. SIDE NOTES:  One final statement...I am a musician.  For about 30 mins prior to my ORB sighting, I was trying to perfect the cadence of each syllable so that every word fit the music just right.  I played my recording over & over singing these lyrics.....

At 6 to 7 seconds in in 3rd pan camera movement, upper left just above the sun you will see a potential metallic object reflecting off the sun, pass in front of the Sun's brightness, its reflection then is overcome by the sun's brightness until the object reappears below to the lower left and then takes a 30 to 35° jog to the right.  Space rocks and satellites do not maneuver like that, it's against the laws of physics, their trajectories are set in motion and can't deviate!  The military does navigate their satellites, they can change direction, never in the way you see in the video.  Could be coincidence but the altitude of the aircraft to the upper right means that it is military.  Notice that you can see contrail but not reflection off its airframe, because it's so small compared to the UFO.

As I made my way to the end of my street I made a right, which left me facing due East, onto a dead end street.  I walked a couple steps before I glanced up at the sky something having caught my eye.  I found that what had in fact caught my eye was a single burnt orange and perfectly round orb/fireball looking object.   The object was silent.  The night was absolutely clear this night and I was absolutely certain this object was not a star or the moon.  For the next 20-30 seconds I’d guesstimate I tried to reason it was some unfamiliar aircraft and I began to look for lights on the object I’d recognize.  Red, blue, or white lights that are typical on more common aircraft.   ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft do not have blue lights.  PD)) As I focused more on this object I realized it was going at what seemed to be a very fast speed, and it appeared to have a hazy effect around it which appeared to emit an off, faded yellow type aura around the orb itself.  The object was low,  I can’t say specifically how low, but I will say it was very large and it almost looked as though it was approaching at an angle as if to land. **According to our local forecast center the Wind speed at 9:53pm on July 13, 2013 was 11.5 mph and its direction was ESE. To continue on… as I continued walking forward I glanced down at my phone which is how I can record the time I saw the object.  I did not think to take a picture or video, for some reason the idea simply was not present.  A minute or so later I looked up to see any changed in the object and did not see the object.  It had simply vanished. I walked home, quickly and somewhat leery at this point (as the object had disappeared).  And continued on with my nightly routine still not entirely sure how to respond or what to think to what I’d seen.   After a couple days I decided to see what I could find online about similar experiences and realized there are many.  I found this website, and although unsure of it, am choosing to share my experiences here.

6,23,18,<1 minute,"Very shiny object in the sky On June 23, 2016, I was driving home from work in Houston heading west toward Katy on I-10.  It was around 6:20pm, so the sun was still high in the sky.  It was sunny and partly cloudy.  A shiny object in the sky caught my eye.  I would say that it was like an oval-ish shape, I couldn't see any sharp edges but it was solid.  The reflection was bright and it made it hard to see the actual shape of the object was.  I did not see it appear, I just happened to notice it.  I was around I-10 and Dairy Ashford and it was on my right, north of I-10.  It was wasn't too high but it wasn't too low on the horizon to where the view of it could be obstructed by trees or anything.  I just stared at it.  There was some traffic so I wasn't driving too fast so I was able to see if it had a trajectory path but it did not move, it stayed at the same position.  I was trying to see if it was a plane, but the way that it shone, it could have not been because it wasn't small enough, the reflection was too bright and it would require a lot more surface area.  The shape of a small plane could of not have cast the amount to light or reflection that this object did and from that distance, it would of been too small anyway.  At first all I could notice was the bright reflective surface, but the more I looked, I could see that it was silver on the bottom part.  Again, it was hard to see the actual shape of the object, but it was solid. There is a small airport on Groschke Road that is between Barker Cypress and Hwy 6.  I occasionally see small planes take off so its not out of ordinary for me to see things in the sky,  I have even seen colorful hot air ballons come from south of I-10 in Katy,  I am not too sure where exactly they come from but it has been a while since I have seen those.  However, this object or I guess UFO was rather large but at the same time seemed far away.  If I would guess where the UFO was on top of, I would guess that it was between the Mason Rd to Fry Rd and Saums to Clay Rd area.  So as I am driving I pass under the Hwy 6 overpass and when I look at the same spot in the sky, it was gone.  I looked around to see if it moved lower or higher but it was nowhere.  The Hwy 6 overpass only obstructed my view for about 5 seconds.  The length of time that I saw this UFO was no more than 1 minute. When I first saw it I felt curious and I was thinking of all the possibilites of what this could of be! en. When I continued to see it, I felt kind of confused because I couldn't understand what the object was and when it disappeared quickly I was just shocked and I also felt upset at myself for not taking a picture of it. I am sure that it would of been visible. If somebody knows what this object was or if you saw it too, please leave a comment.  I have been trying to forget or to talk myself out of thinking that I saw a UFO.  I am not one of those kind of people that think that there are aliens out there or those that do a lot of research on conspiracy theories but I cannot explain what could that could have been but I KNOW what I saw.

8,2,0,5 minutes,Large metallic object hovering over galveston bay Me and my ex-wife were in Galveston vacationing.  It was around 12am and a few clouds where in the sky. We went to the 2nd floor balcony.  We looked up in the sky and saw a blinking light.  At first we thought maybe it was the space shuttle or the space station. We knew it was not any type of aircraft it was to far up to be anything other than a planet or something else.  We continued to watch it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it was.  When we looked over the bay there was a light cloud bank at the time.  Clouds were blocking out the moon light so it was sporadic at times.  And there it was the clouds moved out and the moon light hit a large circular object.  It had a dome on top and below the dome appeared to be what looked like some sort of exhaust ports.  Could not tell what was underneath other than something was protruding from there.  It couldn’t have been more than 100yds from us. You could actually see how smooth the service.  It lasted maybe 30 se! conds the clouds rolled back in and it was gone.  And while this was going on the light was still blinking in the sky and when the object left the light stopped at the same time.  We went inside thinking what the hell just happened.

The problem with that scenario is that there are no trangular formation of stars in the western sky over Galveston at that time.  They did not seem to be moving yet I went ahead and took a few pictures. I basically forgot about the incident thinking that they were stars until just today I downloaded the pictures along with others to make a movie of my daughter coming down a 20 story building on the outside as a benefit for special olympics. The pictures seem to imply something other than stars.  I can send the pictures to you if requested.

On Friday, August 26th, 2011, at about 20:30 hrs, standing on the deck of a friends' beach home on the West end,  I witnessed a large white light appear and disappear three times, at precisely equal intervals. It was a large, silvery-white light that appeared for about 2-3 seconds, disappeared for about 10-12 seconds, reappeared and disappeared again, and reappeared a third time for 2-3 seconds, then disappeared again.  We continued our vigil for about an hour after the third sighting, but did not observe any further sightings of the object. The near-dark sky was absolutely clear, there was a southerly breeze, and the object was about 60-65 degrees off the horizon at a nearly due east location.  It was very slightly horizontally oval and about the size of an English pea held at arm's length.  It was as bright and luminous as a vehicle head lamp with no observable structure in or around the object; no sounds whatsoever were heard emanating from the object. A friend on the deck with me observed the final 2-3 second interval and confirmed the sighting was indeed an anomalous bright silvery-white light, inexplicable in origin, with no sounds associated with the sighting. He called a friend about 40 miles inland and she stated that she saw the same consecutive trio of lights that I saw and was able to confirm that the sighting was at about 60-65 degrees and at a nearly due east location.

I was headed south on Preston Road, about 2 and a half miles north of Frisco, Texas when I observed a bright light in the sky, southwest of Frisco, Texas, with a cloud as a backdrop.  The light was white gold in color, and looked to be at two levels, top and bottom.  It was dusk, but the Sun was still low on the horizon, and thought at first the light might be a reflection of the Sun on an aircraft approaching DFW Airport, which is relatively nearby. I became convinced that the light was not an aircraft or helicopter.  It seemed much too big, like a sudden star in the sky.  Besides, living where I do on the north side of the Metroplex, I see airplanes and helicopters flying overhead all of the time.  I know them by sight, but what I saw this evening didn't resemble a plane or copter at all.

The light then completely disappeared, in the blink of an eye.  The Sun was still visible, so if what I saw was some kind of reflection off of the sun, it would NOT have disappeared as it did.

This evening at approximately 7:32PM, Sept. 9, ’09, I was out walking and looked up slightly to the north, and saw a small black object.  At first, I thought it was a large bird, but there was no wing movement.  No sound, no jet trail, no lights, very black.  It stayed on a steady course from the southwest to the northwest. moving very slowly.  I saw a similar object last July 3, 2008, but the sky was slightly darker, and the object was lower.  It moved very slowly, as I was able to watch it for at least ten minutes, both times. This year, there were clouds, and they appeared high and thin.  The object was black and showed up against the sky and clouds as did the object last year.  I did file a report with the National UFO Reporting Center last year as well.  The object last year, appeared to have some indentation at the top and was very black.  This time it looked more round, but the movement was exactly the same.  There is an air base (joint command) off a! bout three miles from where I live in Fort Worth, TX. in the direction the object was moving.  Last year, when I described what I had seen with a coworker he had seen the same object. He lives close to where I live.  He described the object exactly as I did, moving from the southwest to the northwest.  Interestingly, he said one of his neighbors had their cell phone and it began to make noises and light up as the object passed.  I think possibly it might be a government experiment, but it was very strange.  No triangular shape.  Just a rounder shape.  I did take a photo of the object with my cell phone, but I am not sure I captured it as it was high.  I would be glad to foreward the photo to be analyzed.

Fireworks had begun in the distance; however over an unpopulated area, a bright glow was evident.  Note that it was just beginning to be dark and landmarks were visible. The object was North West of my position; about 70 degrees above the horizon.  The color was bright red along the color of a road flare.  The size I estimate was close to the size of a van or small moving truck.  The object was round in shape and a constant glow that was very visible.  I do not believe it to be a firework product since no others were seen anywhere or anytime during the 4th. The object was stationary for 30 to 45 seconds and went out instantly.  No smoke was observed in the area of the sighting.  I was shocked to read about this in several publications and decided to file this report.

The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones.

If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I've never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark.

The objects began fading after witnessing for 15 minutes and after 20 minutes they were no longer visible with the naked eye. Object Description: The objects were quite a distance away, perhaps about 10-15 miles away.  They appeared small, but again their exact size was hard to judge from such a distance.  They were very shiny almost appearing as aluminum foil floating in the air.  They were very brilliant as they were visible in the peak of daylight. Weather: The weather was clear, and I do mean clear, I did not count a single cloud in the sky.  The temperature was approximately 87F, with the wind blowing less than 5 knots from the east. Aerial Traffic: I witnessed multiple civilian aircraft going to and from ELP International flowing along their typical landing/departure pattern.  There was also an air show underway at Biggs Army Airfield, the air show was NOT visible from my home.  The craft in the sky were not parachutes, as they did not descend they remained stationary occasionally ascending higher into the sky.  They were also not aircraft flares as they did not descend.  Civilian transport aircraft even seemed to fly amongst the objects at one point to avoid the temporary flight restrictions over Biggs Army Air Field.",A LARGE MOON SIZE ILUMINATED GLOBE,EL PASO,TX,LIGHT,2011,-0.30741057,1.374911211,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-1.603674966,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,-2.729562509,0,NA,NORTH,CLEAR

I went inside the house and retrieved my 8 x 30mm binoculars. I focused the lenses, and I cold barely see the object: However, it appears that it had a round center with bicycle spokes, and the object did not move. Since the object was so far I kept losing it since my binoculars were hand supported. i found the object several times, and it appears to have move just a bit or perhaps it was the earth's rotation. I found the object at approximately 18:05 and this time I was looking at TWO objects instead of one.my wife witnessed the first object, and I went inside the house to tell her that a second object had appeared. My wife did not get to witness the second object because both disappeared. I am 65 years old,and my last sighting was in the late 1940's in the El Paso area.At that particular time the newspapers reported that they were Helium balloons., in the both sightings I had to really focus my eyes in order to identify the objects.

It was reflecting the sunlight and was shining silver.  At first glance I thought it was a mylar balloon floating up into the sky but I kept watching and this orb was not moving. It was just sitting there in the sky perfectly still.  It did not deviate at all from its position or shape. The wind was blowing and this orb never moved, which led me to think this was something else entirely.  It was silent.  One of the other parents who were sitting alongside me noticed me staring up and asked what I was looking at.  I pointed the orb out to her and she commented on how it wasn’t moving as well. Before long all of the parents were looking at this thing.  As the sun began to set we noticed the orb getting darker and by 7:00 it appeared to be dark gray in color.

I quickly realized they werent when these two round shapes started to move southwest at a slow speed. After about seven minutes of floating in that direction, we noticed a flicker of reflection,1 as if it rolled from the top end of a cigar shaped craft at one end( round white shape), and made its way round and round until it dicsipated at the other end(round white shape). After it hit the other end, there was what seemed like a long bent foil piece falling down as the two white shapes continued to move southwest still equidistant at the same speed. I observed the falling object and compare it to bent foil. It almost as if someone had bent a piece of rectangular foil several times in equal sections, then slightly unbent it. This is the most accurate description  I can give if someone trys to imagine a falling slightly unbent piece of foil and the reflctions from the sun it gives off as it falls end over end. The object stopped halfway down from the other craft? and what I thought were the suns reflections turned to a slow pulsing glow.

So again I saw this object from many angles.  I was able to watch it for at least five minutes or more.

We were enjoying dinner on her patio and using a star gazing app on my phone to identify stars and planets.  Below is a description I wrote down shortly after the event to preserve the details.   The first object traveled from the southeast toward my neighbor's house, in a northwesterly direction.  The light on the right appeared first.  I noticed it because i first thought it was a star.  When it moved I thought it was a plane.  It was some distance away (mile or more, so distant it looked like a small dot).  It started coming toward us.  I looked at it a couple of times and continued to notice it coming in our direction, still thinking it was just a plane.  I looked away again, but then a few minutes later, it was close to the roof line of the house at the end of the street (four houses away) and it didn't move any closer.  It just hovered.  The light got much brighter.  My neighbor's 9-year-old grand daughter was with me and said she saw it changing colors. Then I checked my flight radar app and saw there were no planes in the area.  When I looked up again, there was a second one (one on the left) but it was much dimmer than the one on the right.  They were spaced slightly further apart but then the dimmer one approached the larger one.  I snapped this photo just as they became about the same brightness.  They continued to hover there, the one on the left occasionally going behind the roof line of the house.  Altogether it was just a few minutes.   Then I looked away to say goodbye to one of my neighbors.  I helped my other neighbor, whose house I was at, clean up our dinner plates.  We went inside her house.  I didn't say anything to her about the lights because I knew she would be frightened by them.  When I went outside again a few minutes later and looked up, they were gone.  I wish I could have continued watching, but I didn't get to see where they went or how quickly they left. Please note that I live within 30 minutes of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, but as stated above, my radar app showed no planes in the immediate area, and the objects were too close to the roof line to have been planes.

We parked in a church parking lot at the corner of Gurley Ave and Carroll. Many other people were parked here as well.  As we were waiting for the firework show to start, I noticed two glowing, red/orange, slow-moving orbs, or what I first thought were fireworks.  They resembled Chinese lanterns floating in the sky, IF they had been on fire.  I was thinking, ""Why aren't they racing upward to explode like they usually do?   Why are they so slow?""  I asked my cousin, ""What ARE those!?""  Then we noticed they weren't going up, they were moving sideways, and I thought it was weird that they seemed to be ""caught in the wind"" and moving away from where the fireworks would be.  They were moving slowly to the Northwest, at approximately 20-30 mph.  Everyone around us was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were.  They were reminiscent of ta! il lights on a car, but far apart from each other.  Also, they were hovering rather low, which is the other reason I discerned they weren't fireworks.  Low, slow moving, and non-exploding. We watched them for no more than 5 minutes altogether.  I got impatient waiting for the fireworks to start and forgot all about them.  That is, until the next day.  My brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, ""I SAW something last night.""  The kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but I instantly knew what he was talking about.  I told him to tell me what he saw, and he described EXACTLY what my cousin, my son, and I saw, and he lives at LEAST 30 minutes away from where we saw them.

I was about to brush them off as someone in the nearby neighborhood shooting off fireworks, until they continued to move closer to where we were standing.   Mesmerized by them, I continued to stare, but managed to get a couple of quick photos with my cell phone.  They appeared further away than they actually were in the photo.  It would have been easy to dismiss these as Chinese paper lanterns, had they not been SO bright and moving sideways and not at an upward incline at all and it was not windy.

It is easily seen as it is commonly brighter than the North star. This strange light sometimes becomes dim like most stars, but for the most part it is unusually brighter than most of them.

About 10 miles out of Carthage I began to see bright, white strobe lights ahead of me.  They were very bright and low to the ground.  I thought that it was a helicopter.  As I approached the aircraft, I had to slow down because I thought I was going to run into it.  As I went under it, I noticed that there was a bright, white light at each corner and one round, red light in the middle of the craft.  The body of the craft was so dark that I could not see it.  The only way that I could tell its shape was by the strobe lights.  The red light in the middle was not flashing.  It hovered slowly over my vehicle from right to left and immediately in front of me.  It made absolutely no sound.  I had rolled down my window to hear if it sounded anything like a helicopter until I noticed that by its shape and lights it was not.  It moved to the left side of my vehicle and flew beside me right above the tree! line.  I was going approximately 55 miles per hour and sped up to 70.  My window was rolled down so that I had a clear view of it.  It stayed beside me for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My three year old daughter was in the back seat and could see the aircraft also.  She was describing it as I was driving.  I looked to the right side of the road and there was another craft simply hovering above the trees.  I passed it, and soon noticed another even higher up.  It was simply hovering as well.  As I approached I-20 in Marshall, I no longer saw the triangular aircrafts.  Until that moment I had never heard of a triangular shaped aircraft.

It alternately flashed candy apple red and silver.  I thought the object had primary oval shape as well as much less pronounced rhomboid features between the color changes--maybe like a metallic pin cushion whose sides briefly deformed into smooth planes.  I checked my weather app at 18:03 after I had lost sight of the object, and it indicated winds were 5 mph from the southwest.  The total view time was about thirty seconds before the object seemed to disappear into very faint wispy clouds or haze.  It is difficult to describe the flight path from my point of view because at first it was moving almost parallel to the ground for a few blocks but then, perhaps as it began to pick up speed, it quickly gained altitude while following a s! traight line.  I believe latex helium balloons I am familiar with from childhood would gain altitude along a parabolic path if observed from my vantage.  My guess is the trajectory of the object I saw would be an absolutely straight shot less than 20 degrees above the horizon.

9,9,17,10-15 minutes,"Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object Late in the afternoon of a bright and clear day, my daughters and I were taking a walk along what is known as Auditorium Shores in downtown Austin Texas.  The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects; however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man’s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.

9,14,20,about 10 seconds,"Green triangle light display over ACL festival in Austin. I was watching Reverend Horton Heat at the Austin City Limits music festival on this Friday night.  It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can't remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I'd seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn't hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn't make it out any more.  I'm ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.

9,10,20,9 minutes,"oval with several bright colors at one point heading south then retreating north east What I saw September 10th 2007 8:53pm. It was a typical Monday, I went to my regular state job which was between 7am to 4pm.  After that I went to my part time job.  There was nothing to my mind that was out of the ordinary.  It was a boring day at my regular job and slow at my part time job since there was hardly any customers.  After getting out of work I went to Target to buy a coke and Doritos flirted with the cashier and went on to the bus stop that takes me to the corner of Wickersham and Oltorf.  This area is at a high point and you can see the downtown area and it’s sky line.  There was a thunderstorm also moving in and was coloring the sky red then lightning would flash. As I was walking to my apartment I saw something flying over the downtown Austin area heading south.  I was standing in the middle of the side walk between Oltorf and the High Point Apartments looking at this thing because it was slowly making it’s way south and it was flying to low and too slow to be a plane.  When I thought it could be a blimp it flashed several colors of red, yellow, blue, in a multiple square formation.  A helicopter with one spot light was flying south and keeping it’s distance from the object.  I would say it flew above the Ben White HWY area and it was flying higher then the object I was looking at.  That was when it reversed it’s direction and headed north east.  (It did not make a U-turn).  I needed a witness but nobody was walking near by.  I called my sister via cel phone but did not answer.  Then at 8:55pm I called a co worker who was outside her house and told her to look south and she let out a big gasp she yelled, “what is that”!  She lives in north Austin.  We stayed on the phones looking at this thing.  As it moved back to the downtown area it moved around the downtown area and moved north east.  It then picked up speed and moved faster and out of my sight.  We stayed on the phone for a while more reveling at what we saw and then ended our call.  I told my roommate of what I saw.  He said he believed me and I told him if he were to come in that night and said he just saw what I just saw I would not believe him.  I am typing this because other people have come forward in the past on a web site called http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Austin My co-worker and the people who saying they saw the same thing I saw is more then I want to think about.  Why it was not in the news I do not know.  About an hour later my best friend called to talk about a possible hunting trip for December.  I did not talk about what I saw.  To me it is now the difference of living my regular way of life.  I do not do drugs, don't drink, nor was I on any medication.  I do not consider myself wanting any special attention from strangers.  I will never mention this to anybody even if the subject is about UFO’s. I do not know where to go from here.  I think UFO’s exist I just would never think I would ever see one myself.  This to me is just plain mind numbing.  I don’t want to think about, talk about, let alone write about what I saw that night.  This will go as far as I would want to go.

It was already near a big cloud and it created what I can only describe as a set of giant smoke rings that were just being spread from what at that point appeared to be nothing.

9,1,21,10 minutes,"massive triangle shaped craft flew directly over me with out a sound. It was in late September early October when I witnessed this event. Me and a friend where sitting outside when I seen what appears to be 2 single lights.  The lights where off in the distance but the way they were moving immediately struck me as odd..they were positioned cade corner from eachother .by the way they were moving in a way that caught my eye..I asked my friend what he thought they were and we watched the lights for about 5 minutes..we both threw out suggestions of what we thought it was..my best description was that it moved like a helicopter. After watching for a few minutes and calling my brother to come look at what we were looking at the 2 lights that appeared close to eachother a moved one left one right in a blink of an eye to either side of the sky.. My brother was spooked and went inside in a hurry.me and my friend stayed outside ..The lights were now accross the sky from eachother..The one that moved to the left appeared to be coming in our direction.the one that went to the right was farther from us and our attention was on the one nearest... We watched this single white light come closer at a very low speed.i couldn't see any shape at this point but from the way it moved and how low it was flying I knee something was very odd. Keep in mind.i do live by an airport and see planes all the ttime and never seen one move this wsy..The movement was more of a hover.the speed was very slow. we could tell it was coming towards the area we were at.i don't know the exact distance it was from us but it was getting closer and closer and we still didn't hear any noise coming from the object. My friend was then spooked and tries to run inside .I grabbed his arm and asked him to wait with me .We stood there another minute and it was getting closer to the point where I agreed and we both ran inside. As soon as I get inside my curiosity just starts eating at me and I ran back outside .I look towards where I last seen the object.nothing there.i look straight up in the sky and it was directly above me. It was a triangle shaped aircraft.i didn't see the white light anymore but red lights that lined the front in a v shape.the rest of the craft was pitch black. My parents property is is a little over an acre and this craft looked every bit larger ..it seemed to be so low I could throw a rock at it.it was completely silent and moving at a low speed.i was in shock or awe from what I had seen. One thing that I still don't understand is why I didn't see it fly away.i forget if I ran back inside or what I did.my mind was running a thousand mph it seemed. I just remember looking back up at it and didn't see it any more.there was no noise or vibration for me to look in its directiom.it was just gone. I started talking to the neighbors right after this took place when 2 jets with huge spotlights .I mean lights that lit up the land huge ,started flying in a big circle around this area. Never has anyone heard jets that loud fly so low or jets with massive spotlights on them around here. This was definitely an odd occurance.i mean those jets were odd due to the fact that no one has seen those either but the triangle shaped craft that flew directly over my mom's house without a sound was scary odd.it was like watching a paper airplane in the air.not a noise.

I noticed it while at the bank, it appeared as 2 bright blue lights, a electric blue in which no other plane I have ever seen has had.   I called my wife who was around the corner getting yogurt, and then also saw the object. I took care of bank business as I watched the object move east and I thought it was going to disappear.

We were walking through a very suburban area of town when we noticed an aircraft coming towards our direction. We hid and watched, waiting for it to pass.   At first we thought it was a helicopter due to its slow movement, but it was nearly silent.  We thought it was looking for us because of how slowly it moved forward, and how low it was to the ground. It was in a dark triangle shape, with white lights at the ends, and a red light in the center.  I believe it had a metallic pattern on the underbelly.  The white and red lights blinked intermittently.  It took around two minutes for it to pass us and go behind the trees and when it did, we got to a higher elevation and could still see it (very low to the ground). It didn't move in an exact straight line, it slowly and steadily turned and turned back to keep forward.  About 25 minutes later, another similar aircraft passed by in the same direction, slightly faster I think and this time it was silent.

3,21,6,over 1 hour,"Light moving in strange patterned flight over Pigeon Forge, Tennessee I was at work at a log cabin resort where I work nights. I stepped out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and saw several stars and noticed one that was particularly bright. As I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in very distinct and changing patterns. Thinking that I must be moving, I steadied myself against the railing and the object was still moving. Thinking I must still be moving, I backed up against the building and placed my back and head against the wall...still moving. I looked at the surrounding celestial objects (stars etc) and they were all standing still. As I watched, the object moved back and forth at breakneck speeds. It wouldn't curve when it changed course but, instead it would reverse direction in a straight line. Occasionally the object would stop and just hover in place, then it started moving in patterns, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in a figure eight, sometimes in a triangle pattern, always stopping and hovering before changing patterns. This went on and on, after twenty minutes, I went and got the two ladies working in the laundry and they confirmed that they saw the same thing. They also noticed that the object was changing colors, always white but sometimes bluish whate and other times a greenish/yellowish white. During the incident, a helicopter flew over, I could hear the helicopter but the object made no noise whatsoever. Still trying to disprove what I was seeing, I thought perhaps that a thermal was rising in front of the object making it appear to move but, just before dawn a heavy fog rolled in and eveything in the sky disappeared except for this object which was still faintly visible. Around 7am, two other female employees came in and I showed them and they saw the exact same thing.

There were so many of these trails that it peeked my curiosity and I began watching the aircraft with a pair of 10x binoculars to the point they were very clearly seen as they were flying all over the sky. As I was scanning the sky and watching these ""smoke trails"" I began to look at a small area of natural clouds, directly overhead but out of the general area of flight of the aircraft, which was one of the very few places left uncovered by the smoke trails and it offered a glimpse of the clear blue sky. That is when I noticed a solid white object hovering in the sky right under the natural cloud cover. It was just stationary in the sky with no movement or sound,Just sitting there as if it was observing all these aircraft which were laying down smoke trails.! It was solid white just the was the same color as the cloud it was near like it was using it as a camouflage. I handed the binoculars to my wife and she was unable to find the object. I grabbed them back from her and I spotted the craft once again. I handed them to her to let her see and she was unable to spot it due to her vision and inability to focus the cheap binoculars. I took them from her again and looked at the craft and it disappeared into nothing. The aircraft made one or two more passes from horizon to horizon and then I didn't see them again. I believe the UFO was there observing the aircraft as they lay down the smoke trails or possibly the aircraft may have been hiding the presence of the UFO from the sight of the public by laying down smoke to obscure the sky..

Lights circling inside clouds over Nashville  My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before. I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we're kind of near (although I don't know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren't seeing anything out of the ordinary. We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I'm sure other cars must have seen them, but there's no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for. We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don't know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I'm hoping someone else will come forward. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SEEN 4/16/09 (of which I posted here) I feel so much better knowing someone seen the same thing 5 years eariler.  The cloud thing is interesting though.. It was like they not want to go beneath the cloud cover, but I could see them clearly once they connected together in the cloud clearing. The cloud thing is strange, it was between walmart and kroger on the busiest street in Nashville, near a communication tower... odd and very strange... I have calmed down a little since then but I cannot enter my apartment without thinking about what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sun was setting so it was not completely light out at the time. Two people, whom I didn't see, were walking out had stopped and pointed towards the sky looking at something and then left ( as I was later told). As I was almost in the door i heard  another person say something like "" look at that glider up there."" So I walked back out in front of the store and tried to see the glider. Two other people now were looking at the ""glider."" The object was located east of where I was standing and was high enough to be visible from the light of the setting sun. At first it was hard to find but when I did I immediately didn't think that it was a glider, and by glider i mean hang glider. A glider would probably not be flying that high near a major city (Nashville air traffic flies right over the area) or when it was getting dark. It was high up in the air, somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 feet possibly, and was very dark colored, most likely black. It was triangular in shape. There were no lights on it to indicate it was an airplane or otherwise. It appeared to be moving very slowly north, northeast as best as I could tell. One of the witnesses towards the end said ""look theres two."" The object or possibly objects either moved away or it was just too dark to see them after a couple of minutes.

8,3,10,10 sec,"star sized object moving at jetliner speed, does a J-turn and doubles in speed before fading late one night as i was stargazing on the hood of my car in a friends driveway, when i saw a moving ""star"". i had been staring in the same general direction for about an hour or so when i noticed one of the stars was moving. at first i figured i had caught a glimpse of a passing satellite or a meteor. however it seemingly acted against my understanding of physics and logic. it was originally moving south to north at about the speed of a passing jetliner and  it was a solid white light about the brightness and size of an ordinary star. i followed it for about 10 seconds as i was curious as to what it was. while watching it i ruled out it being a shooting star from its speed and a jetliner due to its solid light when it suddenly did a J-turn and as it did so its speed doubled before it faded. due to its altitude and speed gathered from its  relation to the stars in the sky i've deduced that such a sudden change in velocity and direction would be at fatal levels to a human and disastrous to an aircraft of human design. the only explanation i can give is that it was far enough away from earths gravity to have the g-forces at tolerable levels. however, going off of this hypothesis would mean that its manipulation in zero gravity is equal to you or i kicking off the wall in a swimming pool.  as we all know, our understanding of space travel is very limited as we only know how to ""ride"" earths gravity and we cant actually change course without using up huge sums of fuel. secondly its size is really unknown. it had to be big enough to be seen by the naked eye  and appear the size of a star. it could be miles across for all we know. lastly the velocity change, this is the part that really rattles my brain. in less then a second its speed doubled and it continued to accelerate up until the point where it was no longer visible. it also covered great distances in that time. about 3 finger widths at arms length in a fraction of a second. I've ruled out planes, satellites, comets and meteors, and even! halluci nations as i was accompanied by a friend. this leaves only the things of ""fiction"", either something man made that has been kept out of public knowledge or something made from an older, more intelligent species, who are probably here to try and stop us from killing ourselves and our beautiful planet. this has been a memory that will always remain at the front of my brain, i still think about it almost every day.  in fact it effectively changed me from a hopeful skeptic to a full fledged believer. in less then a second.","Tracked lights then looked away and then they were gone, nowhere to be found.",FRANKLIN,TN,LIGHT,2006,-0.123805248,1.834654876,0,0.757614224,NA,0,0.0642725,1.078928529,0,0,NA,0.739669356,0,-1.159910312,0,-0.991561816,WSW,CLEAR

6,26,21,20 minutes,"His is my second report this month. Thursday night my wife and I went to the Myrtle Beach boardwalk. At about 21:00 we stopped to observe the sky which had begun to clear… the weather had been hot and overcast…winds about 5 mph from the South. We were standing against a railing, looking East out over the ocean when we observed a luminous object, 2 to 3 times the diameter of any of the few visible stars… the object did not appear to have any motion or direction, was at an estimated 35 degrees above the horizon and a fairly luminous yellow color.   The object “turned off” for about 20 seconds then back “on” for a few seconds. This process repeated itself over a 10 minute period or so…… after that time it or a similar object appeared to the south west…using the Easter position as 12 o’clock, the newer object was now at about 1:30…. It also turned on and of during a few minutes period of time. At about 21:15 we both observed that the light reappeared near its original location but to our surprise a second light now came on to the left side of the first, slightly lower the it and then a third and so on until seven luminous objects were present in a straight line. The line descended downward from right to left at about a 10 degree angle with the spacing between objects equal to 4 or 5 diameters of a single object  The lights “came on” at about one second intervals and as the third object illuminated we both began counting aloud, fascinated by what we were observing. After observing the group of lighted objects for about 5 to 7 seconds, I turned and asked a couple sitting on one of the boardwalk benches behind us to turn around and verify our observations…. By the  time I was able to explain my request most of the objects were “off” but did come back ”on” individually.  The objects continued to cycle on and off for about 30 more seconds. We continued our observations for an additional 10 minutes or so but all the object had gone “out” and remained so. We observed no motion of any kind by the objects, no smoke trails as may be observed with flares, no sound… they appeared to be several miles distant but I had no means of determining that.

6,10,16,10 minutes,"Shiny, rotating object over Taylors June 2005 I am making this report now, after over a year and a half(since seeing this occurence) becuase, well, I didn't exactly know how or who to report it to. Also, I am in South Carolina, and people around here aren't exactly open-minded or welcoming about things like this. I can't remember the exact date, but I do know it was one afternoon, around 4:00 pm, in early June. The weather was not too sunny, but it was not overcast either. It was mild, pleasant weather that day.  I was home with my now husband, our infant daughter, and our then-roommate.  My husband stepped outside onto our front porch to have a cigarette, and I started to follow him out. We were standing on the porch talking when I happened to look up at some birds that were flying over some trees approximately 200 feet away from us.  Right at that moment, a shiny metal object came into my view.  It wasn't close to the trees; from what I could tell it looked like it was at least as high up as a small airplane.  Like I said earlier, an airport is not far from my house, so I'm very accustomed to seeing (and hearing) planes, big and small, fly over the house all the time.  But this shiny object made no sound whatsoever.  My husband saw it as well, and we called our roommate out to look at it. It looked at first liek it was shiny, metallic, and saucer-shaped. It wasn't moving at all. It was just hoovering where it was.  Then after a few seconds of just hoovering there, it started rotating and spinning, in alternating speeds. It looked like it was spinning in all directions, upside down, sideways, and diagonally. It looked as if the entire shape of the object was changing with every spin. It did this for a few minutes, then it would move over to the right and hoover a few minutes, and then it would move higher up, hoover for a minute. All the while there were birds flying around in these tress by our house, and that's when I could tell that it must have been pretty high up in the air. (Because in proportion to the birds, it looked very small.) After about ten minutes, it just slowly moved away, towards the west. I have no idea what it was, but I have never in my life witnessed an airplane or balloon of any kind, behave in a manner like that. To my knowledge, no aircraft or balloon, can hoover in one spot, and completely spin! , rotate , and change shape. And if there were such an aircraft, I highly doubt that the general public would be made aware of it, nor, would it be made visible in plain daylight, in suburban areas.  All three of us saw it. There's no doubt in my mind that it was not something that the airport knew about. I don't know if we are the only ones who saw it, but I still keep my eyes peeled every single day, in case it ever comes back. If it ever does, I'll be ready with a video camera next time. I'd love to know if anybody else saw this in this area. Thanks for your time, and again, I'm sorry it took so long for me to report this.

We instantly were in awe and had no idea what we just saw after the second one.

As I was approaching the store, I saw something flying down in the manner that a plane descends.  It was coming towards me very fast and as I concentrated my vision on it, it changed to a horizontal flight just about 20 feet above in front me and just flew right over my head.  It was about the size of an orange and looked almost like a glowing liquid fire, yellow orange in color.  It had no tail/trail.  I stopped my bike and by the time I placed my foot on the ground and turned around, it was gone.  I looked around and there was no sign of anything.  There was no sound at all.  There was a couple a few hundred feet behind me and I waited for them to reach me to see if they looked like they saw something, and it seems they didn't.

I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups.  I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify.  When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording.  The quality is not the best, and there's a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look. It's clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you'll see), I don't feel confident that it's a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don't think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise.

We live along the Appalachian in PA near the Susquehanna river.  We are about 30 minutes away from the closest airport, so we do have some air traffic.  We are completely aware of what planes look like and do not mistake them as the UFOs.  Most of the time the UFOs seem to be an orange ball of light that we seem to notice around dusk just before the sun sets. Sometimes there are 3 of them that seem to just hover but then dissipate one at a time until they just completely vanish.  They always seem to be close to the river. We also do a lot of star gazing and we can see satellites with our naked eye but a few times we would spot them and then all of a sudden the pin of light would grow into a big ball of light for just a few seconds before returning back to its original size.  It almost seemed as if it was beaming light towards us because it changed its appearance only when it was directly ab! ove us! The most bizarre sighting was a couple weeks ago.  The sun was setting and I just happened to be looking east when from a distance I saw this light slowly rise from the trees between two mountains, which seemed to be close to the river.  I stared for at least 10 minutes as it hovered there with no movement or sound before I called for my husband and his friend over to see what I was seeing!  After 5 more minutes of no movement it finally started to move towards the mountain, it rose as if it was outlining it until it reached the top.  Then we all heard & saw a helicopter coming from the west. The light then dissipated and in place of the light seemed to be a white disk! We couldn't believe what we were looking at!

Something in the sky caught his eye and he first thought it was just a plane with the sun reflecting off it since it was a sunny day.  But he realized it seemed REALLY bright so he took another look and realized quickly that the object wasn't moving at all.  He could see some high clouds moving behind it but the object itself was not moving.  We have two very tall trees in the backyard and the object was viewed in the space between.   He couldn't give much of an estimate on the altitude of the object but it appeared to be where a small local aircraft might be seen. He had trouble believing what he was seeing and he kind of closed his eyes and shook his head for a second and when he looked again it was gone. He moved about the yard to look past the two trees but it was nowhere to be found in the sky. He felt silly describing it because it sounded so cliche, but my husband is a huge skeptic so I believed him when he drew it out showing an oval/disc like shape either with windows or some kind of markings on the side. He said it was very bright, brighter than any reflection of sun would have been (on an airplane). When I came home from work he showed me where he had seen it.  I'm a lover of planes and flight patterns so I understand that planes may appear stationary for a few moments if they're flying directly towards or away from you but eventually you will see the movement.

There was the main group that maintained in the formation, then two of them trailing behind as if they were trying to catch up to the group. I refer to them as ""bird-like"" because I've never seen anything else fly in that sort of formation. But the objects themselves didn't have wings and weren't saucer shapped either. The best way to describe them is to imagine an oragami bird illuminated from the inside. I know it sounds weird, but it's hard to relate to something I've never seen before. It's difficult to say the size. They seemed small, ( in respect to things I usually see in the sky like planes) but I'm not really sure. They were flying below the clouds, and above the tree lines. But it was still hard to judge their distance away. The whole thing lasted about 7-10 seconds. It made no sounds like a plane or birds, just complete silence.

After noticing that the object was not moving, and having concluded it was not a bird, it suddenly zoomed off due east at fantastic speed.

My two young daughters and I were at Clark Creek park in Salem, Oregon, 07/14/15 at around 5:10 pm.  The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.   I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.   I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.   My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.   It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.   It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.   A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color.

I managed to track the formation with my telescope for a couple of seconds and it appeared to be one object shaped like an isosceles triangle.  If it were 2 aircraft then I would have noticed irregularities in the distance between the two, but there was no lateral movement between the two, they kept a very static distance between them.  I believe the shape was distorted because it appeared to be between 2 to 5 miles to my South. The red strobe seemed to be huge and I could faintly see the outline of the back end in the telescope.  The object moved across the entire sky in less than one minute without making a sound.  When I held my fingers up at arm’s length the object seemed to take up 3 fingers worth of sky.

It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- tear drop,hard to explain but I will draw a picture of it.It had some sort of membrane/aura or field around it. Since I already had my binoculars in my hand, I zoomed in on it up close it was squared off in the front like a bay windows yet rounded as it tapered off towards the back,it was totally silent did not make any wild manoeuvres, Stayed at constant speed, no lights or flashing lights at all, it just traveled a straight low line until I could no longer see it.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever.Left no smoke/com trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent, and oval in shape.I could see through membrane but the ""teardrop"" shaped craft was solid with defenent shape.I did not panic, felt no fear or anxiety, just intent on details. Plus it was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading.It was not a plane for it had no wings and as close as it was I would have heard the engines, this craft was silent.I would guess the size -30x20x5' towards the back.

7,20,21,3 hours,"Strobing Ball of light and craft. My cousin and I had been in Pushmataha county on the Kiamichi river to a spot where, 2 months prior,  we had a violent encounter one night with a 15' tall hairy giant that most people call Bigfoot.  He tried to kill us by pushing a large tree over and we barely escaped with our lives.   After this encounter we began returning to the area with the intention of eventually killing this thing with assault rifles.  Once we determined where the creature was hiding out during the day we were preparing a plan of attack to sneak in and try to take this thing out.  One day while we were in the area we made contact with the creature through tree knocking.  I knocked and he responded with knocks followed by an angry howl.  For people not familiar with these creatures, they use tree knocks to locate each other or communicate with each other in the woods.  Anyway we waited around until about dark, but the giant didn't come out of the woods on this day, so we decided to leave since!  We didn't have night vision equipment.  On the way home we were on the highway between Talihina and Buffalo Valley when I saw a strobing light about a mile back in my rear view mirror.  I instantly thought cop and looked down at my speedometer to see how fast I was going.  As soon as I looked back up I remember hearing my cousin say ""What the hell is that"".  To my shock, there was a strobing ball of light about the size of a basketball beside the car.  It was keeping pace with the car and was about 3 feet from the passenger side window.  After following beside us for about a mile, another cars headlights appeared over a hill in the opposite lane and the light instantly shot straight up in the air.  We looked up and noticed that the ball of light went to a larger craft and the craft continued to follow us.  I decided that this had to be related to the Bigfoot creature and they could be following us in an attempt to find out where we live.  We ended up staying out most of the night driving around and this UFO continued to follow us for around 3 or 4 hours.  It finally quit following us when I pulled into a driveway near Wilburton, OK., which is not where I live,and turned off my lights.  We returned to the encounter area the next week and instead of encountering one creature, there were 3, anyway this is a story for a different site, but I am convinced that entities from another world have an invasion going on and all hell is getting ready to break loose someday soon.

7,28,22,10 mins,"night sighting of large triangle object Around July in 1999, my family and I were camping at kaw lake just outside of Ponca City.  It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.   As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn’t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that’s about it.  It was just recently that I saw a show on flying triangle ufos and was shocked that the footage that was shown on that show was the same thing I had seen over the lake years ago.

7,9,10,3-4 minutes,"Triangular shaped UFO passes over my house in broad daylight. On July 9, 2001 at 10:35 am, I was sitting on my back porch while talking with my mother (facing east) on my cell phone, I noticed an object in the sky. They sky was bright blue with some random clouds at very high altitude. Basically a bright sunny summer morning. The object was fairly obvious to notice in the sky because the sun created a shadow underneath the object giving it shape as I was looking up. I initially thought it to be a high flying bird or hawk approximately 250-300ft above the ground. But then I noticed that it had a consistant course of direction and was headed my way. It grew larger as it approached (object was heading due west at approximately 30-40mph). As it approached, it grew in size and became clear to me that this was not a bird or a normal/everyday aircraft as I heard no noise. Living within a few miles of the approach path for the largest airport near our city, and an avid military aircraft buff, I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before nor could I identify. My second impression was that a balloon was let go and drifting, but this object continued to maintain a westward course against a south/southeasterly wind at 10-15 mph and did not change altitude. As I started to mention this to my mother (while on the cell phone and the object now close to overhead and probably just two to three blocks north of my house) we lost cell reception, and our call was dropped. I have always had excellent if not perfect cell reception the 7 years i have lived in my town.  This was not normal cell reception as the closest cell tower is only a half mile away. The object was a very soft triangular shape (roughly the size of a compact car such as a mazda miata or something) and looked disk shpae from the side. So picture a very soft triangle from underneath the object, but was convex or disk shaped on the roof of it. It had a slow rotation to it the entire time, it maintained level flight, never made a sound, and did not roll or pitch in a fashion that a tirangular shaped ballon might tumble while moving along with the wind. It was silvery gray with some shimmer that the sun provided which informed me of the rotation it had. Then I thought, as weird as this was, I would try to snap some pics with my cell phone camera. I quickly took two pictures and I continued to watch the object continue it's course until it was completly out of my sight (heading due west). So I started in the back yard, facing east, and walked to the front yard, facing west, and watched it until my polarized sunglasses (which helped see the object for a much further distance) were of no use and the object was gone. I then was curious to see what my photos had produced. There was nothing in the sky that I could see on my pictures. I had some of the neighboring house tops in as references to possibly size and distance the object, but nothing of the object was visible. I was then a little un-nerved about this. A photo expert may be able to find something or I may have not gotten the object into view while taking them. I honestly cannot say, but I did make an honest effort to capture the object on two pictures. Either way I was extremely disappointed. I have never seen anything like it before. I feel fortunate to have seen something that I could not identify. Wow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

7,22,21,3 minutes,"Unusually bright light moving across the sky. At appx 9:47pm CDT, I was outside on our east facing porch, just watching for satellites and meteors, as I like to do on weekend nights like the one that night:  no clouds and no moon.   I was scanning the sky, when I saw an exceptionally bright light in the SSW sky appx 40 degrees above the horizon.  This light was as much as a magnitude brighter than the planet Venus at that planet's brightest.  This light was moving to the NE and likely took 2-3 minutes to cross from the point of first sighting until it crossed the whole of the sky before disappearing behind some trees to my ENE.   I then moved to another part of the yard and was able to watch the light past the trees until it was lost to sight on the far ENE horizon.  I believe that it passed to the north of both Antares, and then Saturn, but to the east of Altair.  I don't believe that it got any higher than maybe 50 degrees above the horizon, maybe less.  The light was silent the entire time.  The light was solid the e! ntire time, neither blinking nor dimming.  I say it was solid to say that it did not blink or waver.  But it was so bright that it caused it to be more of a Venus-like glare, rather than a simple point of light.  It only dimmed as any light does as it moved farther away into the distance. In a single sentence it was as if Venus was moving across the sky. Over the years I have seen dozens if not hundreds of satellites.  I have seen many that seem to appear from nowhere and become very bright before quickly dimming to nothing.  In the moments just after spotting this light and seeing that it was not blinking (like an airplane) I assumed that it must be a satellite and expected it to very soon dim.  It never did to any extent.  I also felt that it was moving erratically, slowing then speeding up and wavering very slightly from side to side.  I say this because it was what I felt I was seeing.  I can NOT say that I am certain it was acting oddly.  Realizing that this was like nothing I had seen before I went to the door and asked my wife to come outside. She agreed that it was much brighter than what we had seen before. Without my prodding she said that it seemed to be moving in the same odd manner that I have described. Another point I want to make is that we live appx 7-8 miles NE of Tulsa International Airport and see many low flying aircraft near our home either just after takeoff or turning west toward a landing.   Just as my wife was coming to the door, I began hearing sounds of an airplane, and started to feel that was the explanation.  But when I looked up I saw the airplane lights moving from the S to N but beginning a turn to the west that would take it behind our house towards the airport flight lanes.  The bright light in question was already well to the east. When the plane was lost to sight the sound went away.  Again I did not hear any sound that I would associate with the passing light.   There is a National Guard Center about 5-6 miles to our south and they house a number of military helicopters.  I have seen them flying in the area many times.  Later, I considered that if this were a helicopter, for its lights to have been that bright, it would have to be flying rather low, and I would certainly have heard that familiar chop chop sound. My wife and I also considered the idea that it could have been a drone of some kind.  I don't know much about them but will say that other than the possible side to side waver I was feeling, this light traveled in a very straight line from one end of the flight to when it disappeared on the far horizon. To me this was an object that I could not identify with any certainty and since it was moving, flying in the sky it was a UFO.  I EXPECT that you will determine that it was indeed likely a satellite.  I expect that you have satellite information at your disposal and you will end this mystery quickly.

I build custom cars and motorcycles for a living and work in a private shop on the outer northwest edge of Oklahoma city.  During these hot months I will work late at night and early mornings to beat the heat. On Saturday, july 21, 2012, at approximatly 10:00 pm I was headed to work.  At about three miles out from the shop I noticed this mass of lights ahead to the west and northwest.  I was coming from the east and noticed more and more of the lights as i progressed toward the west.  I was on W. Memorial ave between N. Rockwell ave. and N. Council Rd. As I approached Council road that is when i saw the most lights at one time. They were a glowing red/orange that did not flash but seemed to appear and disappear according to the angle you were veiwing them.  By then I had my phone out and was attempting to record these lights while trying to get safley off the road.  The large group of lights were in some type of triangular formation headed straight west, there were approximatly 15 to 20 lights in this formation and the angle of view would be 25 to 30 degrees.  As the large group went out of sight there were smaller groups, say 4 or 5 lights and i saw three of these smaller groups.  These are the ones I captured in the first video and were coming from the north headed south then turned to the west and followed the large group that was out of sight by then.

7,4,22,1-2 minutes,"We saw a low-flying, brilliant, orange object flying silently and steadily from SSE to NNW and are sure it wasn't a traditional craft. My husband, son and I were outside watching nearby fireworks at 10:35pm CST and from the SSE we saw a brilliant orange hovering object heading to the NNW.   We thought it was a local helicopter but as the craft approached it was silent and brilliant in color, like a burning ember.   It was not close enough to discern a clear shape, but seemed almost circular.  It flew in a very controlled manner at a consistent altitude and speed.   The speed was like that of a helicopter also.  The altitude seemed to be somewhere between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  Difficult to really estimate the altitude because of our uncertainty of the nature of the craft.   After it had passed over us and was almost out of our vision field we noticed that the brilliance seemed to weaken just a bit, but then reappeared as it continued on its path to the NNW.   The duration of our siting was probably 1 minute, or slightly more.   We are certain it was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor a satell! ite or slow burning shooting star or firework.  We have never seen a flying object like this.   We do not consume alcohol, nor drugs and have excellent vision and judgement.   We are sincere in submitting this report.   Thank you.

10,7,12,~4 minutes,"UFO over Oklahoma Just after 12:30 on lunch hour I had gone outside to the designated area to smoke.  I turn to the north eastern part of the sky and see this cylinder shaped object moving at a slow speed from north to south.  It's about the size of a quarter at arms length and pure white in color.  When it got just past halfway middle of the sky it appeared to change shape, like the front half had slowed down and the back end had to catch up and it had a more cigar shape.  Its direction changed to a slow arc toward the sun.  Then in an instant it starts to shape shift probably because the sun was reflecting off of different surfaces, it gave the appearance of rapid movement back and forth and from side to side violently, it would appear in one spot then disappear and instantaneously appear in another spot near to where it previously was then again and again and again maybe 7 or 8 times  looked like it had a different shape each time while continuing in the same direction.  T! hen it shifted 3 or 4 times more only less rapid and growing brighter as it approaches the sun.  It stops at a distance of about a dime held at arms length from the sun and by this time is as bright as the sun like a mirror held up to it, only much smaller.  It stays in that place for about five to six seconds then it appears to back away a little and all of a sudden it's not glowing any more, it is still close to the sun and should be still glowing but it's not, it has stopped reflecting any sunlight at all and  become a darker greyish color thin horizontal bar shape, much less visible than when I first saw it but can still be seen.  It held that position briefly, then it punches out, to a dot in the sky then gone.  I was oblivious to time but I think 4 minutes or so.

I was closing a window in my home that looks toward the south and I saw a redish-orange light that was flying to the north.  It appeared almost like fire burning in the sky and when I called my wife into the room to view the object, she at first thought it might be a helicopter on fire.  We watched as the object continued north for approximately 1 minute and it then made a turn to the west and traveled that direction for approximately another minute.  About 30 seconds into its flight toward the west, it changed from orange to white and afterward, the light dimmed-out.  The object was flying at low altitude; we are guessing at possibly at 3 or 4 thousand feet and we are certain that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  The color and brightness of the light was unlike what one would see from an airplane.  We also wondered about the possibility of a hot air passenger or weather baloon but with it maintaining the constant light and changing directions, we knew this would rule out this type of object.

7,4,21,1.5 hours,"2 dozen red orbs, in 2's and a group of 5, with multiple origination points and directions of travel Preamble - My wife and I have, for the past 4 years, taken a short ride out in the car on 4th July evenings.  We have the intention of 'UFO spotting' as a pleasant pastime, looking for what the general public may not be looking for up in the skies.  For the past 4 years, we have seen odd, unusual objects on the Independence Day evenings.  I have a good knowledge of aircraft night illumination, types of aircraft and do fly R/C aircraft, sometimes at night.  I used to live on the approach to Manchester Airport, when living in the UK, til 2007. My wife has a similar degree of discernment regarding known standard aerial objects, including satellites, stars and high altitude aircraft. While there is the local Davis Field airport, air traffic is in the order of 1 or 2 light aircraft per day and perhaps a military or hospital helicopter on infrequent occasions.  Our skies are therefore relatively clean of commercial passenger aircraft, it being an uncommon sight to see even a contrail. Sighting this year, 2012 - We set out at 21:20 and headed South approx 5 miles, away from the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where we live.  By 21:35 we were positioned in a pull off area on a dark road and looking North toward the city. Wind direction was SSW at 6mph, as checked on wunderground.com and remained similar all evening.   Such a fact may be important for considerations of the report, or those from others local to the area, if they are received. Within the melee of firework activity, 2 groups of 2 red lights could be seen to be moving East to West at a distance of approx 3 miles distant.  The lights were tiny spots, slowly moving West and seperated constantly by a short distance, equating to around 20 lengths of object size.  We then saw 3 groups of the same type of lights moving from the West to the East, behaving in the same manner. Speed of travel could be estimated anywhere from wind speed, to 50mph, depending on the actual distance of the objects, which is unknown.  Slow in any case and linear, without dramatic differences in direction of travel.  A slow climb was noticed with several groups of the lights. All objects 'floated' along for 1/3rd the viewable sky, until they would disappear and all behaved in the same way. We decided to head North West, to see if we could find an origination point. My own thoughts were of Chinese lanterns, a candle inside a lightbox, suspended from a parachute or balloon.  Such a device could, feasibly be what we were watching, though wind direction would have to be changing and launch points.  However, my wife informed me that this tradition is not carried on in the United States, and especially during the drought conditions our area has been experiencing. We arrived at a veterinary clinic on Peak Boulevard and pulled in to the car park. Over our heads we witnessed 2 of the orb lights at about 50ft distance from us.  They slowly made their way Northward, no sound, glowing a bright red.  Size is estimated to be anywhere from football sized to car length sized, it being quite difficult to discern physical distance from us. We DO have video footage of that incident (uploaded to YouTube and not set to Public):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3Jro3yEkvo  I apologize for the quality, but, it shows the distancing between 2 of the lights.  We intend to purchase a better night quality camera in the near future. We continued to head West on Peak Boulevard, past the casino and into the country, where city lights would not prohibit our view, in the hopes of again tracing any launch point of the objects. On stopping at another pull off area, we noted several groups of 2 orbs moving from another start location and then, a group of 5, closely spaced in an approximate diamond shape. We had been studying the sky behind us, moved back to face the original direction and saw the group of 5. It is unknown how they arrived in that placement or from which direction. Within 10 minutes, 2 more were seen in the sky, travelling from East to West - which completely defied the wind direction again and the previous emanation point. The total was either 23 or 24 bright red glowing balls of light, in tandems or in a group of 5. All aerial objects were sighted coming into the field of view, with none originating at ground level or from high altitude. Average flight height is deemed to be the height of firework bursts (200ft ?). The orbs were seeimingly floating in toward the city of Muskogee from many different directions, during the 1 and a 1/2hr observation period. The wind direction, being constant, removed personnal thoughts of balloon lanterns and hence is why we are posting this report.

7,4,20,every few minutes for alm,"Videotaped 20+ silent orange orbs traveling solo & in groups; not airplanes or fireworks Observer #1 – female, age 40  There were five people in our group – two adults with doctoral degrees, one 15-year-old, and two children, ages 5 and 3. We were viewing fireworks in a parking lot in the center of Durant, OK, on University St. and 19th Avenue.  I was facing southwest along with my family when my husband saw the first orb of the evening.  This was the one that came closest to us. (The weather was warm, sky was clear and there were no clouds in the sky whatsoever. When it got darker, around 9:00-10:30pm, we were able to see many constellations from the center of town). Close to dusk, approximately 8:40pm on July 4, 2012, we saw a bright orange orb-like object smoothly move across the sky from the south to the north.  The object slowly passed over us and with the contrast of the darker and lighter sky with the sunset, I saw what looked like a larger, dark portion on top of the orange circular light.  It traveled overhead for about one minute before completely disappearing and suddenly toward the! north/northwest.  However, as it traveled, the light flickered inconsistently, like a candle. It did not blink as an airplane or water tower light blinks, rhythmically. Unfortunately, we had not yet set up our video camera and tripod to catch this object.  We had seen similar objects the past three years on the 4th of July, so we decided to try and videotape this year.  As a result, we taped almost 30 minutes of footage of various orbs coming and going from 8:45pm-10:20pm.  While the camera is older and the footage is often shaky, the moon, buildings, fireworks, trees, and other structures can be seen.  Our five-year-old daughter also spotted some of the orbs. Most of the orbs seemed to be about the size of an aspirin or somewhat smaller from the distance we were located.  Some seemed further than others, but one thing was very clear – they were NOT fireworks, flares, or airplanes.  There is a small regional airport on the southeast side of town, however, I don’t think most private planes take off as quickly or in groups as these orbs did.  And, all of the orbs were identical in size, color, and flight pattern.  The only difference was the speed, some traveled a little more slowly than others but all headed from south to north/northeast or northwest. Shortly after our first sighting, we began to see one orange orb after another, sometimes two or four at a time, pass from lower in the horizon from south heading north/northwest and completely disappearing after 30 seconds to one minute.  They did not travel like an airplane would but rather seemed to be traveling much faster and in a linear fashion.  When more than one orb appeared at a time, they looked as if they were in a formation or following one another.  They all were light orange in color and flickered. I was primarily facing southeast since most of the orbs seemed to originate from that destination just over the horizon.  Later in the evening, closer to 10pm, the orbs were further to the west of town but still originating from the south.  This also seemed to coincide with the firework activity.  Again, the orbs can be seen on the video, and they clearly are higher and further away than the fireworks. Observer #2 – male, age 15  I saw from about 20 to 30 glowing orange lights most of them flying in the same direction I don’t know how often they came but it was mostly after a bunch of fireworks went off. They started at about 9 and they began to slow down as people stopped to do fireworks they seemed to be about the same size but some looked a lot closer than others; some also seemed to move faster or be brighter. The first object that I saw looked the nearest. The sun was still up but barely, you could see a dark irregularly shaped thing on top. It seemed to have some kind of hook around the light and looked like it was holding the light, the rest of the objects did not have this. The other orbs would be there for about thirty seconds then at some point disappear with no trail behind it. Some looked red but would than turn orange but would become orange. They would also slowly ascend at different rates. There would also be multiple lights at the same time. They didn’t touch each other and I couldn’t tell if there was a shape to connect them.  The first object I saw came from the south of town but the majority came from the southeast. All of them looked to be going north, northeast but all coming from the south. They didn’t blink or dim at all. They were bright orange lights that would last longer than any of the fireworks and move in a small diagonal path ascending but slowly. I couldn’t tell how fast they were moving or the exact distance they were. The most I saw at one time was four and that’s when fireworks were the most active.  They were all silent. No sound could be heard but the highway and fireworks. Observer #3 – male, age 42  Date: July 4, 2012: I was present at the location of the sightings primarily observing my two young children during the experience. I was also lighting some small fireworks for my kids. The first sighting this year was confusing to me because I could see it even though it was still rather light on the western horizon (we arrived early before people started lighting most of their luminescent fireworks). It was an ovular object that was black in contrast to the sky with an orange light on approximately the bottom quarter. It appeared very low on the horizon and I found it bizarre because it was so visible. I had seen the orange colored orbs on the two preceding 4th of July holidays; but, I had never seen the unlit black portion above the orange light. It floated across the sky, from south to north, without making a noise. I asked my wife and 15-year-old stepson what it was. We were all baffled because it was so, well, blatant. I tried to set up the camera in time to capture it! , but was unsuccessful.  I wasn’t set up for recording because it was still early in the evening. Our camera was set on autofocus (because I hadn’t read online recording guidelines prior to our first attempts at recording these objects), so I was unable to capture it on film before it traversed the full length of the horizon out of view. After this, my focus was primarily on my children. We were in an empty parking lot in our rural town; but, I am very careful in keeping an eye on my children, especially with all of the fireworks that were being ignited around us. Durant, Oklahoma, has a city ordinance that allows the lighting of fireworks within city limits only on July 4th of each year. So, people really light a lot of fireworks in our town on this evening. That being said, since I have seen the orange orbs glide across the horizon for three consecutive years now, I was always looking around me to see if there were other orbs intermingled with the fireworks exploding all around us. I saw many. Some were very distant; others were much closer and clearer. My wife took over with the camera, and she and my stepson tried to capture as many of the orbs as possible on the 30 minute minidisc we had in our standard definition camera. I saw approximately 20 of these orbs myself. Most were on the eastern side of Durant city limits traveling south to north/northeast. A few appeared on the western side of town and seemed traveled south to north/northwest. The ones that were closest captured my attention the most. They appeared to be orange with a hint of red in them. The close ones also seemed to have a sort of halo or light haze around them that could not be captured by our outdated video camera. The orbs seemed to be traveling solo, however, there were times when more than one was in view. Also, when viewed in the northern sky after they passed, I could sometimes see three to five at once before they disappeared out of view. A few constants I wish to provide with regard to these sightings: The orbs were all very similar in color and shape and did not waiver on the vertical plane. Closer orbs traveled at a quicker pace than more distant orbs; but, they may have all been traveling at the same speed due to their relative distance. None of the orbs made any noise as they traveled, although the fireworks being discharged in their peripheral were making plenty of noise, which may have concealed noise if I take all possibilities into consideration. The frequency of their appearance seemed to coincide with the number of fireworks that were being discharged into the sky, which I personally interpreted as providing concealment or a form of camouflage for the objects. When we packed up to leave, there were very few fireworks still being discharged. There were also very few orbs in visible in the sky by the time we left correlating with this decrease. I am an educated man.  I have attended 10 years of college and am, quite honestly, a skeptic. I seek data and quantitative evidence before I believe any hypotheses or theories regarding any phenomena (my motto is “show me your data”).  I am not by any stretch of the definition a conspiracy theorist, but rather a diligent and responsible observer of the world around me. I have tried to make sense of these sightings over the past three years using what I have learned in my education concerning astronomy and the other physical sciences. I have clearly ruled out these orbs as being airplanes as these objects did not have the typical light patterns, sounds, or smoke trails of private or passenger airliners. My best personal (and humble) hypothesis as  to their purpose (which goes beyond describing the tangible evidence before me) is that they are mapping the land as cartographers of sorts or perhaps scanning for minerals beneath the earth. But, that goes beyond the purpose of this ! report.",Coloured flashing lights before sunrise over Oamaru NZ,DURANT,OK,SPHERE,2012,-0.477901225,1.752922669,0,0.321208976,NA,0,0.0642725,0.947823847,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,-1.255040748,0,NA,SOUTH,CLEAR
8,5,23,10 seconds,"Basketball sized dull reddish orange Orb flew decidedly around tree tops and past my 3rd story apartment balcony. My husband and I spend most of our evenings on our apartment porch.  We are on the corner of the 3rd story and face an open field next to our apartment complex.  We're the only ones with this amount of an amazingly open field view at this complex.  Though it's an open field, it is outlined with trees, some of which are close to our porch.  From the porch of my 3rd story apt about 20-30 ft out from me, just above a tree top, I looked up and out just in time to randomly see a dull orange/red orb come over and around a tree top right in front of me.  I didn't sense it, it made no sound  at all, and even though it glowed orange and reddish orange it didn't cast enough light to shine on to anything.  So with that being said if I hadn't just looked out at the view in front of me at that exact moment, I would have never seen it, I would have never known it was there at all.  It moved fast and direct.  Staying just inches above the tree tops, moving decidedly around the tree! tops.  Too fast, too silent and too weird of a light to be a drone, too close and too small to be mistaken for a plane or helicopter.  A big storm was brewing in the next town over (Broken Arrow/Tulsa) that we could easily see amazing lightening take place from, but the weather was very calm and pleasant where we were.  Almost no wind or noise, just a calm night.  By the time I registered what I was seeing and started to say, ""Wow look at…,"" to my husband, it was gone without a trace.  The whole thing took place in under 10 seconds, my husband was lighting his cigarette while this was taken place and there for didn't see anything.  The weirdest thing of all, it didn't fly away, shoot off or land.  As soon as I made a sound to form the words Wow, it was that exact moment, mid-flight past our porch it just vanished! Gone. Not up, not down, not hiding... light off in the blink of an eye, no traces left, gone. Poof. Next day I had a strange, realistic dream (occurrence?) during a midday nap.  I felt the need to wake and check on my kids but when I tried to sit up and roll over I felt drugged, no strength, couldn't hardly move or open my eyes.  I managed a weird flop and roll over, tried to say my daughters name but it sounded sluggish to my own ears.  I managed to open my eyes just enough to be blinded by a very direct bright pin point of a light.  I asked my husband later that day if he had come home from work on lunch and for some weird reason shined his phones flashlight in my face or something haha, but he said no definitely not.  All I know is I must have immediately gone into a deep sleep and woke what felt like only 5 to 10 minutes later but I can not be sure.  Everything seemed fine in the house when I did get up, my daughter was asleep on the couch and my son was in his room on the xbox. I went outside to my porch to just take a minute and reflect, thats when I noticed a wicked bad bruise on my left calf muscle with no explanation as to when or how I acquired it.  A day or two later a solid white perfect circle appeared in the bruise, next day another perfect circle appeared right next to the first one;  Both in the middle of the bruise.  That's also when I noticed there were solid pea sized hard lumps.  One under each white circle in the middle of this purple, blue, green, yellow bruise.  A few days later the circles became outlined in perfect red lines that almost resemble spider veins but much softer, smaller and lighter and in an almost honeycomb shape.  The bruises and red lines are gone now, but the hard mass is still very much there.  Also it stopped feeling like two individual pea sized knots and started feeling more like the size and shape of just one Tylenol pill. To sum it up: Softball/basketball sized orb, dull reddish orange glowing orb, flew around a tree top and past me on my 3rd story apartment porch.  When my presence was made known by me attempting to alert my husband of the orb, it blinked out of sight. Next day I had a very strange nap that I felt I couldn't wake up from and when I tried I can barley recall a bright pinpointed light shine in my eyes while I was in bed in my room and I fell back to sleep. Later same day, I found a big bruise on my inner left calf muscle that was shaped like a dogs paw print.  One big bruise with 3 medium to small bruises just above the big bruise.  Bruise was wicked, dark purple, blue, green, yellows and next day a small white perfect circle appeared, than another of the same size right next to it, then I felt the hard object under the bruise.  Bruise is now completely gone but the hard mass is still there.","Seen objects that appear to flash red, green, violet. All spectrums of light. This event has been happening on clear nights.

These small lights made me think it was an airplane.  Then I realized that it could not have been an airplane because it just stayed in one spot and it did not move.  Then all the sudden it turned back to its normal state, which was a yellowish orange ball of light reminding me of fire.  The size of this object was about 1/3 of a full moon.

8,24,20,15 minutes,"Large aircraft with bright white circular lights on its bottom half that hovered but could also move extremely fast August 24th, 2011  I was sitting on my sofa when I noticed a bright white light out my back window. The light got closer and moved at a very fast pace.  I said to my husband “what is that? What is that?” We both got up and went outside to my back porch.  It was a very large UFO, perhaps the size of a football field, I am guessing.   Even though it was very high up it was still massive in size and relatively low as we could make out that it was round in shape.  We observed the UFO coming out of the North and heading towards the South.  We stared in awe for a moment as it came towards us.  There was absolutely no sound and it just hovered, then it made a wide U turn towards Tontogany (Northeast) and at that time we were able to see the lower half of the aircraft which had, what looked like to me, at least four circles on the lower half of the UFO.  Each circle appeared white but when I got my camera and took a video the white light came up on my camera screen as being multicolored and blinking o! r flickering, although it did not appear this way to the naked eye only on camera.  In person it appeared solid bright white lights but on camera is was a range of colors blinking.  I have a couple videos, one is very descent but I am somewhat disappointed that I didn’t capture it at its closest range in which we first saw it.  At one point it seemed to lower or drop rather suddenly, which I also have on camera. I only caught about 30 seconds of it before it disappeared above and beyond the town of Tontogany.  Interestingly, we also saw and heard a airplane on the North and opposite side of the sky so we could actually compare how loud and how little that was in comparison to the UFO. Whatever it was, it moved incredibly fast and I believe it had the potential to move a lot faster than we witnessed, maybe even lighting fast.  The first sighting was at about ten minutes til 9 o’clock pm so it was still somewhat light out but dark for the most part.  We live just outside Tontogany, Ohio which is a very small town in the rural area outside Bowling Green, Ohio.

Feeling tired, I went to bed at 9pm, leaving my husband to watch television.  My eyes were drawn to the outside, as the flashing of the fireflies was quite striking to see.  As it grew darker, the fireflies were more noticeable.   I decided to rise from my bed and sit on the floor, resting my arms on the window sill to watch them.  Our window provides an eastern view and for a change, I noticed the night sky was clear and I could see the stars.  Not having done this in a while, I looked for constellations.  My eyes were drawn to a very bright ""star"" in the sky, positioned over our yard.   I also noticed a jet flying in from the south with its blinking lights and it was too far up in the sky to hear it.   Again, I was drawn to that bright star and wondered if it was a planet.  After a while, it started to MOVE.  It was closer to the earth than was the jet, because the jet passed behind it.  I thought my imagination had kicked in, or that perhaps it simply was the earth's rotation causing this ""movement.""  I used the window pane to gauge the movement and YES, the ""star"" WAS moving!  It moved in a southern direction then STOPPED.   The ""star"" took a 90 degree turn away from me and headed east at a steady speed.  I watched it until it disappeared, which took very little time.

I moved slightly to block the sun’s glare with the gutter, and had a clear view from 8’ to 10’ away of what looked like a metal ball - solid, perfectly round & smooth and the size of a baseball.  It started moving slowly to my left with the dragonflies moving with it.  I tried to rationalize what I am seeing as a bubble or seed pod - but it was not a fuzzy outline - but a solid perfectly round ball.  I looked around for anything else in the sky, but don’t see anything.  Continuing to watch the object, a 2nd ball - identical to the first  (but with no dragonflies) moved slowly into view on the same track and height reducing the distance between the two until just above me - then it went straight up vertical from horizontal at a right angle increasing speed slightly (maybe x 2) as the first object continued on same track & height.  I was astonished that I had seen something that shouldn’t be there.

7,15,14,5 Minutes,"Triangular UFO seen in daylight, with U.S. jet chasing My husband and I were traveling to my parents' house one afternoon when I saw this very large, triangular shaped aircraft traveling above us. It wasn't going very fast, and it was close enough to the earth to see detail. It reminded me of an arrowhead in shape; it had three points, a light orange light on each point, and the back end of the craft bowed inward between the two end points.  I rolled down my window but could not detect a noise.  The craft had no noticeable markings and seemed to be made of metal, which was a medium gray. It was not shiny; the outside of the craft had a dull finish to it. Both my husband and I watched it as it continued straight, then made a ninety-degree sudden turn to the left. It suddenly started flying off toward the distance at a much faster pace than it had been going, and it was soon out of sight. My husband and I were talking about what we'd seen when a U.S. Plane that looked like a jet came from the direction that the other aircraft had come from. This plane was loud, fast, and a dark gray to black in color. Where the UFO had made a ninety-degree turn, the new plane turned as well, although it didn't turn as sharply or as quickly as the other craft had. It followed the trail that the other aircraft had made, zooming out of sight in the same direction. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else saw this craft in action that day. It was about two in the afternoon in the middle of summer, and the route the air crafts took was along the same route of a popular road in our hometown. This craft was very large and like nothing I had ever seen before, so it was bound to gather attention. I did not hear anything about this craft from anyone else whether through word-of-mouth or media afterwards, although I did look out for more information.

Object/light hovered in one spot for about 2-3 minutes, then disappeared when camera auto-focus beam went off.  This just happened last night.  I was at the computer...my wife was doing the dishes...we both kept hearing an unusually loud, low pitched, rumbling sound, going overhead...We could not tell, from inside if the sounds were jet engines, or the wind.  I had gotten up and looked outside on three earlier occasions to see what it was, or if I could see something flying overhead.  There was, in fact, a constant howling wind all evening.  But, there also was a steady stream of jets, aircraft, or something overhead.  I couldn't see them because of the cloud cover, but I could hear them, that is, apart from the wind.  And, I could hear the Doppler pitch change in the engine sound as they passed by.  Except for the chemtrail planes (I have 100’s of photos) there are no regular flight paths over my place. There also are no major airports nearby.  We have two community airports, Potsdam & Massena, each about 12 miles from my location; one due west, one due north.  Fort Drum is approx 80 miles southwest of my location.  There were no stars or moon visible, there was a low cloud cover, and it was quite windy...I could not tell from inside if the sound I was hearing was the wind or a jet engine...which is why I kept going outside and checking.  Just before I went outside for a fourth time (and this is where it gets a little weird), I said to my wife: ""I keep getting a sensation like I am being watched, or stared at;"" like when someone is standing behind you and is staring at you, and you can almost ""feel"" it.  The thing is, she was off to my left, in my field of vision, doing the dishes; and we live alone?  I went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbor's barn, who happens to be a Detective, BCI, with the NYS Troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light/object...we live approximately 150 yds apart.  The light wasn't reflecting like the moon...it was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, I could only see light, I could not see an object, just a light.  I was looking slightly North of West, up at an angle of approx 35° from the earth...the object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...there were no other lights in the sky...I live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution.  The object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering/ceiling last night.  I asked my wife to get my camera, a Canon Power Shot S2-IS (it gets a little weirder here).  As I pulled the camera up to my eye, I was thinking I was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all.  I was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...I zoomed in some on the object and was I thinking; “I'll take this picture, and then I'll take another with the flash up/on and see if the object responds to it.”  I had the auto-focus on, and when I squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam.  Then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (I have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1/8 of a second…. just after I zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, I saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue, violet, and green sphere with white light shining through the colors with a blotchy sort look...it kind of looked like a picture of the surface of sun, except this was blue/violet/green...that's when the shutter went off...and that is what the picture shows. I can’t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the “zooming” that caused me to see it differently throught the viewfinder?  My wife didn’t see what I saw, the change in the objects appearance/color from bright a bright white light, to a blue/violet/green sphere…she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; “where did it go?”  I could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...it seemed to just disappear….I didn’t even think I got anything on the exposure.  I pulled the camera away from my eye to see if I could re-find the object without the camera.  There was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been.  I could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; “Did you see that?”…Everyone sounded quite excited, so was my wife and I.  It looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above.  Although, I could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object/light had been.  The illumination was growing fainter quite fast...so, I pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...it doesn't show much...just looks like there’s some slightly illuminated fog.  I haven’t talked to my neighbor yet.  I've known him since he was born, and I don't know if he'll even admit to me, let alone anyone else, that he was outside looking up too?  I can't imagine he's going to go on record, considering his position...he's a detective with the NYS Police, BCI, 25 years.  I hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend, I'll see what happens.

We watched it move towards us and get dimmer until it just disappeared.  That was the first time we saw it.   My kids returned to the house and my dad and I sat down to watch the fireworks.  The second time we saw it the fireworks had started, all of a sudden we saw it again, still south of us but this time more East, we watched it and it disappeared again.   The third time was in about the same place as the first time.  It seemed to rise straight out of the fireworks, it moved northeast a ways and then just disappeared again.   ] The fourth time the fireworks were over.  My dad saw it first and it was more East this time,  It seemed to move towards us for a bit then switch direction and move away from us then it just disappeared like the other times.

I immediately noticed a bright light in the west about 20 degrees up.  It was flickering, i knew it wasn't a star.  I got the binoculars and saw it had flashing lights, red, white and an occasional blue  or green.  A few times a bright beam of pinkish light shot out to the side.  The light stayed in one spot except that it occasionally moved a hair sideways and back, or in a small circle.  I couldn't get the binoculars to focus sharply on it, although I can focus on the craters of the moon or a jet at 35,000 feet.  After a while watching I sort of decided that it was in a triangular shape and was rotating. I walked down the street to get a better look.  At the top of the beach i noticed another light, same deal, out over the lake.  This was not like any of the lights I've seen out there.  When I had a clear view of the sky I saw that there was another one low in the northwest, like over toward Toronto. About 11:15 all three were suddenly gone.  They didn't move away, they went out. I came in the house and was heading into bed when there were five bright flashes in the southern sky, like a flash going off. There was never any noise from any of this.

There was no sound from the object that we could detect although it seemed to be close, perhaps a couple of hundred yards away at the most.  It then seemed to gain speed and ascend quite high into the atmosphere and began to head NE at what then seemed to be quite a high speed, as it disappeared from view in less than a minute.

I was outside on the front porch with my mother for a cigarette.  She pointed toward the sky behind me, suddenly very animated.  I turned around, still sitting, and saw what looked like huge glowing orange lights in a perfect V formation moving in sync over the trees across the street.  It was silently heading our way in a cluster.   We hurried to get a closer look and stood watching from the highway.  About three more appeared as if out of nowhere; if anything they were already up and lowered to meet the rest as opposed to floating up or rising.  They were moving together, the first three more in sync though the spaces between them were not perfectly in unison as we continued to watch them head our way.  My mom was panicked and thought they were actually coming to us, since we were the only people out watching (it was a little before 11pm and we are mostly surrounded by shopping cente! rs that were closed.)  They had to be either very big or not that high, though higher than the trees.   The first three then began to curve around and turn away, going over the lake and disappearing.

It was a clear night, so I sat down on the porch and leaned back to do some star gazing. A few minutes in, I noticed that some of the stars were moving, in tandem.  I focused in on that area, and there were 5 “stars” in a V-formation.  I realized that it was a fairly large triangle-shaped craft of some sort, because I could see the dark shape blocking actual stars from view, as it passed overhead. It appeared to be quite low in the sky, was quiet, and moved slowly.  A shimmering light passed all over the bottom of the craft several times, independent of the five V-formation lights.  I watched it cross the sky until I couldn’t make it out any longer.  I’m not far from Stewart International Airport (public/military), and suppose it might have been a military plane. Of note, the street lamp on the corner went out while the craft passed over, then started glowing slightly until it reached the normal light, seemed to get brighter than usual and orange-tinted, and abruptly went out again.  The lamp remained dark afterwards.  The bulb probably burned out and the timing coincidental; but it was odd, so I thought that I’d mention it, in the case that anyone else had witnessed a similar coincidence.","Possible UFO over Green Bay, WI.",HUDSON,NY,TRIANGLE,2017,-2.366413103,-0.668393967,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,-0.151438487,0,0,-0.055151095,1.836979716,0,0.932959285,0,0.061549893,WNW,LIGHT RAIN

About three miles away from where I was, on his porch, there was a bright (almost as if it was a headlight) blue sphere in the sky.  It was probably two football field lengths distance away from the top of the houses.  It was foggy out at that time so I could not make out specific details of the ""object"" but the fog had a blue haze from the sphere.  I'm not speculating whether or not it came from Mars, but it was a very odd event to witness.  After about one minute the sphere immediately disappeared and the blue haze with it, although the fog remained.  It left me feeling a little nutty because the object was so bright and had form to it and then it was like you blinked and nothing was ever there.

I was alone and had entered my complex when I saw a large saucer shaped spacecraft. My first thought was that what I was seeing could not be for real. It was so big and unmistakably an alien craft, or a projection of one, that I could not believe what I was seeing. It appeared to be spinning and changed colors. The only colors I remember vividly were pink and green. Because of the size of the craft, I started to get nervous thinking that this could be an invasion. Instead of stopping I slowly turned down my street and eventually lost sight of the craft. I pulled into the driveway and went into the house for my binoculars. I was not able to find it again. When I returned to my house I put on the Sunday night Football game to get the score and I had some old fashioned radio like static for a couple of minutes.

I noticed in the SW a tiny black dot slowly going upward a little to the left and right.  I thought it was a Mylar balloon that someone had let go of. Then it just stopped mid air, and then it started moving NE slowly just outside a storm cell I was watching.  It appeared to be entering just inside and outside of the Cloud Cell. As it got closer, it appeared to be just near Stratosphere Casino but much higher in the sky like ½ mile higher in the sky.  It was well defined at this point, black, flat on the bottom with a small point on the top center of it. At around Stratosphere Casino, it stopped again, and then started increasing speed, and in a matter of maybe 3 to 4 seconds, it went from Stratosphere Casino, to just left of Nellis AFB.  It looked like it was on a collision course with the mountains, when I lost sight of it as it went under my line of site as trees were to the East of me and the mountains. I heard no noise, no sonic booms, and did not hear any impact and did not see any visible signs of debris flying up as if it impacted something. From my vantage point, I can see Stratosphere to Nellis AFB, I guess that’s maybe what 25 miles between the two of them?  As it speeded up from virtually a stand still hover over Stratosphere to speeding out of site, it only took about 3 to 4 seconds travel that 20 to 25 miles, I know when the jets hit their burners, you see the thrusters flames and loud, like I said this was totally silent and no flames, just extremely fast and quick. It was traveling much faster than the fighter jets that pass by here every day.

9,3,1,5-10 seconds,"Two lights north of Las Vegas, hovering and eventually gliding until it disappeared. I was out working out in the backyard of my home at around 1am while listening to Coast to Coast am. My backyard faces north, the house faces south. I had a clear view of the northern sky, Nellis AFB is to my north east at about less than 7 miles from my home. I have seen many terrestrial and known objects in the skies: satellites, fireballs, shooting stars and even unique aircraft like the stealth bomber, all within the city limits. Tonight, I saw something that was very unconventional to the aforementioned objects. The object was simply two lights, one bright light and another less bright light at around the 11 o'clock mark above the brighter light. The object just appeared out of nowhere towards the north and not anywhere near the AFB, I would say the AFB is more north easterly while this object was straight north. The distance between the 2 lights was greater than the distance of an airplane's wingspan, that is what caught my eye. As I saw the object, the lights seemed to hoover and then eventually glide in perfect unison at an angle, the reason I think I was seeing it at an angle, is because I was assuming I was looking at a solid object but looking it at while it was making some sort of turn. The object glided and it seemed to move east at first and then eventually turned north and disappeared, the disappearance was odd because it seemed like it disappeared into some sort of haze or fog, but there were no clouds that night. It might have disappeared behind the mountain, but that does not explain how both lights just vanished, as if flying into a cloud, which I have seen aircraft do flying behind mountains and clouds. This was definitely the closest thing to a UFO I have seen. I did take a video of the even, but the image is too dark to see anything.","Original case, I think.

I was in front of Marilyn Redd Park when I looked to the north and saw a gray disc shaped craft hovering about five hundred feet in the air. It was perfectly still and made no noise what so ever. It was hovering just to the east of the Mesquite air port and remained in place for about two minutes. It then departed to the north and within one to two minutes was completely out of sight. It was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen. According to a map, it was about 2460 feet away. From my point of vision it was about two inches long and one-half inch high. There is no way in this world that I could have mistaken it for any thing else. The color was gray and reminded me of the color of a side walk.

2,16,13,20 seconds,"02/116/08 in Laughlin, NV a disc shaped object was in the sky, non-moving but tilting at different angles. My husband and I were on our way to the movies and heading toward the Laughlin strip on the highway  95 coming from Kingman, AZ when my husband  who was driving said “What is that?” I looked up and there was a plane flying across in the distance  directly in front of us. I told him it was plane, obviously.  He said “Not the plane, where did it go?”, then exclaimed and pointed “That!” I leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and  at the upper left side I saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. It was tilted at an angle toward us and didn’t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. We couldn’t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up. I watched it for a few seconds in shock that I was seeing my first beyond a shadow of a doubt ufo , till I realized I had my camera with me and I told my husband to pull over on the side as its visibility was lost from me where I was sitting and fumbling for my camera to turn it on. When we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. We stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing. I asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up  and saw it. At that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. It was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. As my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned “right” side up where he lost it for a second then it became “visible” again (and when I saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again. The only other ufo that I, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of Kingman, Arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over Arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, Kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon.

Against the grey cloudy sky the object was solid and a darker black-grey reminding me of the skin of the Stealth Plane. The object moved from the N/NW going in a S/SE direction. I lost sight of it behind two trees, but it re-appeared again about 60 seconds later. It seemed to be traveling rather slowly and flat so the visible area was the triangle with the lights below which stayed on continuously. There was no sound.

7,12,1,2 Hours,"Lights (red, green, yellow, orange and blue) rotating around a brilliant white light due west of Las Vegas at about 30 degrees. It initially appeared to be a star or planet due west of Las Vegas at about 30 degrees above the horizon, but closer scrutiny with binoculars and a telescope showed colored lights rotating around  awhite the object.  Colors were red, blue, green, yellow and orange.  While it appeared to be stationary over the two hour period it actually gradually dropped from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  I thought it might be a satellite but after checking the orbit speeds and trajectories of the Hubbell satellite and the International space station, it was easy to rule them out.  I also checked ""stationary"" weather satellites speeds and orbit and ruled them out.  Whatever this was, it had to be outside the earth's atmosphere and did not appear to be orbitting the earth.  I have never seen a celestial body that had distinquisable lights rotating around it like this object.  If you know what it is, can you tell me?  I have attached 3 photos I took of it with an inexpensive digital camera shooting into the eyepiece of a $100 telescope.

He said he thought it was a flare but then when it cMs ovst the butler building he thought it was a missel or a millitary rocket.  But when it got closer it looked like a fite ball or orb.  Then exploded as it took off and left real fast.  I didnt see it yet.  But as we were gking on break walking to the shop.the butler building the maintenance shop.  The orb was not a missel or a rocket. It got really close and I stood in amazement.  And it was glowing like a fire all around.

Alot of construction and bulldozers are channeling.the water and the water detention basin to get the wetlands to flow.

9,26,18,10 seconds,"A Sphere of light was seen hovering next to the Stratosphere building in Las Vegas. I was driving on a road aligned toward the las vegas boulevard, this was a small street. I was heading East toward the Las Vegas Blvd. the road that I was on is probably 200 yards in length, it is a residential road. As I drove down the road, I was able to see The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, this is a very tall building. nothing out of the ordinary at first as i turned onto this road that headed East. Maybe halfway down, I noticed a large sphere, golden and radiant, it looked like the light from a lighthouse shining directly at someone, but with a perfect bright sphere shape. This sphere was hovering in place perhaps 2/3s of the height of the Stratosphere building. slightly to left of the building from my perspective, which would make the sphere be on the North side of the building, 2/3s of the way up. I wasnt sure what it was and immediately it peaked my curiosity as soon as I saw it, it didnt really change in brightness from what i could tell, I was in a moving car. As soon as i got to the end of the street, i turned right (South) and the stratosphere was now being blocked by a commercial building across the street that i turned right onto. When i saw the stratosphere again, maybe 20 ft after made the turn, the sphere was gone. I also noticed a black helicopter heading toward the stratosphere from the North, and it looked like it was flying around the same height of where the sphere was. There should be a point made that there is no way that the helicopter could have been the sphere i saw, because the helicopter was MILES North of the Stratosphere, headed TOWARD the Hotel.

5,25,13,15 minutes,"bright object over las vegas that sped off at high rate of speed I was outside smoking meat and watching my kids when I looked to the west and a bright sphere shaped object appeared in the sky.  The object just appeared and didn’t seem to originate from any direction.  It was a white yellowish in color and was brighter in appearance of other aircraft in the sky.   At first I thought it was a piece of trash or a balloon in the sky as it slowly drifted east towards my direction.  I went inside and got my Sony A330 DLSR with Sony 75-300mm lens and was able to get one good pictures due to forgetting my memory card in my computer.  Getting my camera out was just to see if I could zoom in and see what it really was.   At the same time I told my wife there was something in the sky but thought it was a plastic bag but made the offer to come out and take a look.  The drift was almost like a sudden wobble and pause motion as it moved east.  In Northern Las Vegas it’s pretty common to see a plastic bag or balloon caught in the wind.   What made this different was how bright it was at the same time I could see the direction of the wind due to the dust in the air with my sun glasses and it was traveling against the wind.   Once the bright object slowly made its way over Nellis AFB.  It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the south and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.  There was an aircraft taking off from McCarran International Airport which was near in location of the object but the two were probably greatly separated by altitude and distance. I am in the United States Air Force and living on Nellis AFB and I can watch aircraft from Nellis AFB coming and going, as well as the air traffic lanes for takeoff and landing from North Las Vegas Airport and McCarran International Airport are great reference.

7,27,15,2-3 minutes,"Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  ""Janet"" plane in Las Vegas I smoke cigarettes from my second floor balcony many times throughout the day.  My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those ""Janet"" planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight.

I work for the airlines and I am familiar with aircraft of many kinds in various types of weather and lighting conditions and have never seen anything like this before.  They literally looked like balls of fire floating in the sky.

Nine round lights in an almost vertical direction ( 90 degree angle into the sky above) hovered but were mostly stationary over the N/NW part of the city of N Las Vegas.  The lights were equally spaced apart and would get bright and then dim in patterns.  For example, all lights would turn bright together and then dim, whereupon the bottom most light (maybe starting 250 feet above the buildings and homes) would turn a red color, the 2nd through 8th lights would go bright up the almost vertical line of light one by one, successively, after the other until the ninth and topmost light would grow bright red.  I and five other witness watched this for about 45 minutes straight. The patterns of the lights glowing bright white and then fading out almost completely, was constantly changing, almost pulsing at times, and the lights were moving very slowly, not breaking formation  due West.   As we were all viewing this event, a light appeared in the sky in front of us, South of the formation and closer to us.  It shot upwards after appearing and faded out completely. Additionally, closer and to the NW, we observed another bright light appear, and  travel at high speed for a second and disappear.  Appeared high up in space.  To right of the Big Dipper.  We all also observed another shooting light orb appearing out of nowhere and shooting upwards, arcing and disappearing. this was again South of the formation to the North and lower and much closer to our viewing position. Finally the formation moved West at a faster speed, all lights disappearing but one, which proceeded to grow brighter and much bigger.  At peak light intensity it vanished. We could no longer see anything in the sky to the North.  About a minute or less after the final large round light went out, as we were talking about it, we looked to the North East as a huge bright light caught our eye.  It was traveling in a South Easterly direction and appeared to be a large white light traveling very fast.  It was pretty close and low, and large.  Very bright white. It too vanished by going from extremely bright to dim in milliseconds.  Then it was gone. Looked like the large light from the formation, at the end.  Don't know if it was or not.

Since it was very cloudy throughout most of the valley, I became a little bored and started to look around the sky.  Upon looking at the mountain behind our house I noticed a couple white dots hovering over the mountain.  I thought they were airplanes at first because that is a normal route that is used when they are coming in to land at McCarran Airport.  After a few minutes went by they still had not moved any closer and stayed in the same area.  I then noticed more lights appearing next to them, there were approximately 6-8 more lights that appeared right next to each other.  I was able to see the lights moving around from left to right and a few of them would disappear then reappear for the next few minutes.  After another minute went by we had seen more lights appear closer to us, but still over the mountain.

Where we viewed the objects moving down the mountain I did not know that there was trail that high up.  I had found this out the next day using google earth and verified that these lights were moving down that same trail.  We live approximately 300 ft. away from the mountain and will normally hear vehicles or off-road vehicles driving on the road below the trail.  There was no sound at all and the lights appeared to be hovering over the ground.  I also thought that they may have been people walking/running on the trail, but that didn’t explain the lights hover above the mountain.

7,3,21,1 second,"Looked like a ship coming out of warp, lasted 1.5 seconds. Wasn't sure if I should report this due to the shortness of the event but the more I think about it the more I am sure it was a strange event. For geographic location, I am in the far north west of town in Las Vegas, Nv. We are far enough north of Vegas that we don't really get the light pollution like down in town so we have a very nice night sky. We had just gone through a week of clouds and overcast and this was our first clear sky in days and the 4rth of July we had clouds and rain all day/night. On Thursday July 3rd I was sitting out in my pool around 9:15ish pm. The sun had set but the sky was still in twilight and not dark yet. I was laying back looking up at the stars and checking out the constellations. When in the north sky I saw what I can only describe as a ship coming out of warp going from north to south.  It left a streak in the sky about a half inch long at arms length but it was a wide light like a highlighter rather than thin like a pencil. Now here is why I think this was weird. I spend a lot of time at night looking up at the sky, I know how falling stars look, I watch satellites go by  on a regular basis and I have seen the ISS over dozens of times and know its speed and brightness. In fact at 8:15ish pm I saw the ISS fly over (south to north) and fade out just like I had seen many times. Most every satellites I see here are usually going from south to north. Most falling stars I see are much faster and the streak is much longer and thinner. I am under the flight path for most military jets from Nellis AFB but they fly from the base to the training range (east to west) over my house then back a little north of me from West to East. Generally with a lot of noise and very identifiable by their lights and speed. In fact I was thinking earlier in the night that they were not out doing their regular night time training and the sky's were quiet that night. I never see flights from the north to the south due to two reasons.  The mountain range is very high to my north (Gass and Sheeps peek) and due north of me is actually area 51 and the groom lake complex. It is a No Fly zone for the normal training flights from Nellis.  Even the famed Janet airline flights don't do North to south, they do NW to SE to get to McCarran.  And don't fly evenings. So here is how this went down. I am in the pool laying back looking up at the stars and due to the way my yard and pool is I usually look north to it being the darker part of the sky. I heard what I thought was a plane, which drew my attention to an area I wasn't focusing on, when all of a sudden, I see this streak and at the leading edge of it is a bright shiny object. The streak was only half an inch long and appeared like the old star trek shows where they come out of warp and leave a short light trail. My first thought was a plane with landing lights but when the trail and light went away as fast as it appeared I looked to the area to the south thinking I would see the plane continue through the stars due to the sky still being in twilight but could not find it. This is seemed strange to me for the fact that nothing ever comes from our north to the south and the way the light looked.

It appears as if I am not the only one who has seen them, however I see no reports of this in Las Vegas yet.  I was on my way home last night and I made a right turn onto a surface street (facing north) and saw the orange lights flying in the sky.  Others were slamming on their brakes and I assumed a speed trap, but they had seen them as well.  I didn't get a count of them but I personally saw 10-15 of them.  They were about a football field apart, were orange and flickering like a flame.  It didn't appear to look like any type of aircraft light to me, and there were no standard red/blue lights on the wings like normal aircraft have. They flew slowly, but seemed to change direction rather quickly.  They were moving as if they were connected by an invisible string.  Half of them rotated, as if they were pivoting on the center light, and the other half pivoted the other way, pivoting on the center light.  The lights quickly changed from a straight line to almost a letter V, but not perfect like you would expect from military. I assumed perhaps it was after-burner light coming from a military plane, so I rolled down the window in my car and sat there.  I heard absolutely nothing.  Everything was completely silent, other than road traffic. It was the strangest thing I have seen in a long time.  Las Vegas is the home to Nellis Air Force Base, so I thought maybe it was something coming from there.

The ship was large with a 300 to 500 ft long triangular sides and looked like a flat black wing which seemed very super sonic.  The unusual thing was the lights, they were not mounted on the superstructure.  There was a rigging made with black pipes attached to the fuselage that held the lights and protruded out from the ship about 10 feet.  I questioned how they could fly through the atmosphere at high speed with lights like that.   There were seven lights, one right on the point and 3 each down each side.  They were large,  rectangular, the longest length vertical.  They were 3 or 4 ft high and 2 or 3 ft wide.

8,25,18,5 minutes,"Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005. Towards the end of August, 2005, I went out in my backyard to look at the thunder clouds about 5PM.  My backyard was high, faced east and had an unobstructed 180 degree view being forty feet higher than the rooftops to the east.  Thunder storms were developing and cumulous clouds were building.  As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of ""Sunrise"" Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o’clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.  To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.  I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o’clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o’clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.  I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects “keel over” in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.  I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.  My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.

6,15,21,5 minutes,"Red lights, low humming, central Nevada, two witnesses   I was working in the Sage-Steppe desert for four months, on a wildlife study. Our base camp was about half way between Eureka and Carlin Nevada on Rte 278. Middle of nowhere. I had the evening off, and decided to start a camp fire shortly after dark. I had just opened a beer and was playing my guitar when the red lights showed up. Before I start my description I have to say that my recollection of this sighting is hazy, it happened over a year ago, and even a few days later I could not remember details. What I remember is a very low pitched, quiet hum.  That is what go my attention.  I looked behind me, and two glowing red lights were hovering near by. I set down my guitar and stood up, walking toward the lights to see better. I noticed another set behind them.  I could not see the outline of any object, only the lights, but the way they were moving, it seemed that they were connected.  They were moving strangely, as if the objects were long and flat and turning from a horizontal position to a vertical position.  It took me a minute to realize the red lights were connected and the object was enormous. At some point one set of lights came close, or at least it seemed close due to the scale of the object. I would say it was at least 50 meters in diameter.  I do not remember the object leaving.  That is the strangest part. I was sitting at the campfire, and was not going to tell any of my coworkers (they were small minded) when they came back from the field.  One of my co-workers, who I had a good rapport with came to the fire and stood there with me for a few minutes before saying &quot;I just saw a ufo&quot;. I nearly pissed I was so excited.

A friend and I were on Highway 39 about 2 or 3 hours away from Tucumcari heading south southeast.  I told him since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was so dark there was a good chance we might see a ufo so keep an eye out.   I had been staring at different stars for almost an hour when for whatever reason I fixated on what I believed was Venus because it was the brightest thing in the sky since dusk.  After I had been staring at it for about 5-10 minutes I saw a smaller light that seemed to come out of it or at least out from in front of it.  I blinked and squinted to make sure it wasn't just my eyes playing tricks on me and it was still there.  I blinked a few more times and before I could tell my friend to look it had completely disappeared.   Around that time my friend that was driving kept telling me he was seeing a pulsing white light over the horizon in the opposite direction.  I looked a few times when I he said he saw it but I missed it every t! ime.

5,6,14,1 hour,"Visit to Famous Socorro UFO Landing Site Lonnie Zamora. During early May 2016, my family took a road trip involving visits to CA, AZ, NV and NM.  Of course, we wanted to visit Roswell and Socorro, NM, and we did.  Prior to our departure, I watched my documentaries and videos regarding the Lonnie Zamora UFO incident on April 24, 1964.  I was really fascinated with this case because Lonnie Zamora was a sworn police officer at the time of the incident which I believe makes his testimony and credibility noteworthy. A recent documentary video in particular caught my attention.  2 researchers who were working with Ray Sanford (I believe he arrived on scene April 29, 1964, and was able to perform an investigation with the assistance of Dr. James Allen Hynek) gave a presentation regarding up to date information obtained through continued research into this incident. In particular, was a claim that approximately 1 year after the incident, both Ray Stanford and Dr. Hynek returned to the landing site.  I believe I have seen a few pictures online confirming the same.  It is alleged that Ray Stanford took random snap shots of the area and many, many, years later discovered objects flying in the air  off in the distance.  It is my understanding Ray Stanford, at a later time when appropriate, may share those pictures with the public. While visiting the landing site which has been marked with rocks and a mural memorial to Lonnie Zamora, I decided to take some radiation readings and random photographs of the area. Nothing jumped out during the radiation testing but upon later examination we did discover an object in our photos that was not seen with the naked eye.  To confirm there was something in the air, I did use MUFON's free to the public image analysis tools.  While I am no expert, it does appear to verify we caught something in our photos.  The object appears to be metallic, grey colored and oval/round. In addition, prior to driving to Socorro we visited a Native American petroglyph site approximately 1 hour north.  We took many pictures of the drawings on the rocks.  After we discovered the object in our Socorro photos, we decided to more closely examine our petroglyph photos too.  It was then we discovered in 1 of the photos an object high in the sky that was not visible with the naked eye.  This object appears more oval/elliptical. We are not saying what we caught on our photographs is extraterrestrial in nature.  It could very well be a plane, bird, some sort of flying debris, etc.  However, it is worth noting that at no time did we hear any noise or observe any jet contrails in the sky.  These photos and videos were all taken with a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 mobile phone.  So we were surprised that we captured something with the limited capabilities of a mobile phone vs. a real camera or camcorder. I hope one day Lonnie Zamora's name is fully cleared and any doubt about his testimony will be put to rest.  RIP Lonnie!  If NUFORC would like copies of my digital photos and videos, I'd be more than happy to share them.","Orange orb moving N to S off the east coast of Edgewater, FL; normal movement until a sudden burst northly like a shooting star.",SOCORRO,NM,OVAL,2016,-0.55658922,1.395344263,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-1.825544428,0,0,NA,3.853658216,0,-2.824692946,0,2.518810546,SOUTH,CLEAR

Our next thought was that it could be a helicopter, but there was no detectable blade noise and the distance between the lights was closer to an airplane wingspan; it would have had to have been a bigger helicopter than I'm aware of in existence.

It was circular in shape and what was really apparent was a large cone shaped light that it emitted downwards.  The light was huge, roughly about ¼ of the horizon and formed the shape of an upside down ice cream cone/pyramid.

I never believed in UFOs/ETs until I saw a UFO in Portsmouth, NH, on Banfield Road (the back road parallel to Route One) in November 2003.  It was a Triangle shape with a white light at each point.  I instantly thought it was probably a plane since Pease International Tradeport runway was like less than a mile away. My girlfriend at the time and I were traveling south on Banfield and saw this white or orange or orange-white bright light through trees and finally it came over the road directly above us and as it was jist about over us it INSTANTLY changed directions, doing 180 and heading back the way it came without even slowing down. We tried to chase it around the block (up to route 3 and back around) and still could see the bright light as I called my mom.  Then it was gone.  I later speculated if it could be a hovering harrier aircraft but it doesn't have that light configuration and again it didn't slow down at all when it did the 180 directly over us.

7,7,12,5 minutes,"Orbs,Orbs, and more Orbs It was around 12:15am and 12:30am of 7/7/13 when I received a call from my neighbor. I answered his call only to be told to rush outside with my camera to the park that was located directly out front my building.   My camera battery was dead and I knew it so I immediately put on my shoes and just ran out the door.   As I approached him he was standing at the furthest point of our small park looking towards the west at the horizon just over the tree's.  I asked him what it was he was seeing and he preceded to point and say look just over the tree's.   Then I saw it, an entire fleet of orbs some red and some white.  Some were in formations of two side by side really close and others were flying around slowly like dust would in the glare of the light coming through a window. I saw about 15 to 20 orbs all coming from the west just over the tree line and then proceeding to head towards the south direction.   There was NO SOUND, they were far away though but you would think! that many planes all together would give off some sort of sound eventually.  My neighbor was taking photos but I have not talked to him yet since the incident but at the time he said they weren't all showing up on his lcd screen but I will find out soon if there is valuable data. I was telling my neighbor how crazy and awesome it was and he preceded to tell me that before I came out their were hundreds more of them.  He actually said that if he placed his hand in front of him he wouldn't have blocked them out of view.   The sky was faintly cloudy but I could still see stars from behind the thin cloud blanket.  All the orbs would get to a certain spot in the sky and suddenly just disappear.   Then about a minute or two after they all had gone and it seemed as if no more were going to show up, I turned around and looked at the sky just trying to look every where at that point and I saw a very wide but faint light going around in a circle in a clock wise direction against the clouds.   I told my neighbor while he was on the phone with his wife and he got off the phone walked over to me and saw it as well but it seemed like it could have been a spot light coming from somewhere in Manchester so we just decided to ignored it and it eventually stopped. I don't know who or what was flying last night but we do have a  Airport close by. But if it was military why would they fly in the hundreds risking freaking everyone in Manchester out.  Too many questions would be asked but that’s my opinion.  I will admit I have seen plenty of weird things in the skies and I have actually gotten used to it but when my neighbor whom always makes fun of me for admitting to being a believer calls me freaked out and sees it for himself it is a great feeling.   I have learned to not get too far ahead of myself and I understand there is many things these could have been but I have ruled out  Meteors, Lanterns and balloons.  I'm just curious as to now who else had seen them because it has to be impossible that these went unseen by anyone else.  These orbs were floating around for a good five minutes or more.  They were over the highway and plenty of residential areas.   I want to also find out what was flying in Manchester, N.H., for planes at the time of this event.  Does the city know?

Minutes pass by as my friend and I were talking about the what Earth would look like from space. 11:34 p.m CST.(The Sighting itself) Now at this time I was just glancing around in the sky when I first saw it and pointed it out to my friend. It looked like a meteor at first from a very far distance. This was in the East/South sky, about 75-80 degrees. It was such a bright flash of light compared to other stars and it didn't just go away. For a minute I thought it was just another planet. Then thoughts crossed my mind if it was a man made satellite. It couldn’t have been however. It was moving different directions. First traveling towards the South sky. Then it began crossing in a back and forth motion. It would occasionally stop for a minute or two. Then it would go back up and move in this back and forth motion. At this point I stood up knowing it was not man made, as my friend tracked it, I ran quickly grabbed my high powered laser pointer (10 Mile radius Class 4 green colored) my friend pointed it out and we shone it to see if there would be reaction from it. It did seem to react which was very interesting meaning it must have spotted this light, at least a very low power of it. As soon as i shone at this light, it stopped and stood still. It didn't move for at least 5 minutes. It moved again and I shone at it again. The craft stopped again. By this point my friend and I ran inside and changed and began looking up who records these sightings. 11:48 p.m CST.  (The call in)  After seeing this I began looking for somebody who would take in this sighting.  I googled exactly where to report and immediately called the hotline. 11:50 p.m CST. I told the man at first how i swear it was not a prank call.  I forgot his name (I asked at the end and completely forgot) I explained it as “A fireball"" looking thing that switched directions in the sky”  It was in more words but if I were not so panicky of giving a 15 second detail it would've sounded better.  He told me to make a report on what me and my friend saw and in a way he could describe it.

It wasn't reflective at all, and I didn't see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn't match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.

The ovals moved toward the south and then appeared to vanish.  A single oval then moved quickly across the sky; it appeared to move more quickly than the preceding ovals; it moved the distance of my view (about 30 to 45 degrees) in about 10 seconds then disappeared; after this oval disappeared, an additional oval came across the sky not as fast as the previous one;   the sky remained clear for about 5 minutes then I note! d 2 orange ovals moving from north to south; the lead oval appeared to slow down and the following oval almost seemed to merge with it but did not; then the lead oval turned easterly and disappeared; the last oval also changed direction to the east and eventually vanished from sight.

While en-route my mother was driving and we were Northbound on Highway 52 by Burlington, ND.  Due to the elevation we were at we could see across the Souris River Valley. At the fork of the Des Lacs River and Souris River approx. 700 ft above the fork was round object approx. 70ft in diameter that appeared as though it was on “fire.”  I use fire in quotes as the fire appeared to start at the bottom of round object and flowed upwards in expanding then contracting rings around the round object until it reached the top of the round object.  The ring of “fire” would flow slightly above the object and disappear. The flow of the fire was not very fast taking about 10 sec. from bottom to top. There was no smoke coming from the object that I could observe but it did appear as though it had heat distortion around the object.  The object hovered in position for about 5 min and we turned onto Johnson St. and after we made the turn south bound I looked back and the object was gone.

On the night of April the 18th of 2004, myself and my mother were witness to a greenish/grey disk shaped object, some miles away, and I can only guess, around ~7,000ft off the deck.  This object was first observed as I walked from a friends house back to mine. It looked at first like a star, but seemed very bright.  We observed the object painfully slowly move across the sky in a Northerly direction.  Over the course of 30 minutes this object moved about 1 mile, if I had to make a guess.  It then began to rise at an angle of about 30 degrees and then slowly made a dual loop going back in a Southerly direction from whence it was originally spotted.  It completely a full two loops over the course of 15 minutes, and then began going up, down, and side to side in the same area, maybe 1 mile in length.  I happened to have borrowed a friends digital camera just a few days before, and started zooming to the cameras maximum onto the object.  Three photos were taken, and wh! at I found later blew me away.  A clear and classic disk with a half bubble shape in the center is seen while the object is (I think) tilted towards me.  Two consecutive photos show the object from its side, and reveal an oreo cookie type craft of two disks sandwiching a center black (From that far away and being night time,  I could not see the center) area.

I have never really believed in this sort of thing, but I just saw an object in the sky over south Charlotte at 8:00 p.m., 6/15/2014.  It was black and seemed to be a semi-circular shape but seemed to change shape in a slow, wobbly manner.  Almost like a blob or jellyish type structure.  It did not look natural. It either had a bright white light or some sort of reflection of the sun, but it was slowly spinning so the light would come and go. It was directly over me and in plain sight at low altitude.  Someone with terrible eyesight could have easily seen it.  I watched it for over five minutes, probably closer to ten.  It moved very slowly, gaining in altitude pretty steeply in regard to how quickly it became too difficult to see.  I recorded it from my phone, but it has no zoom.  By the time I decided to find my phone and record, it had floated quite a distance.  It was indistinguishable on the screen because of its altitude and the sun and lack of zooming ability.   My neighbor walked out as I was filming.  He watched it with me.  By the time he saw it, the object was at a greater distance and higher altitude so he asked if maybe it was a weather balloon.  It was not, though.  It was almost thickly transparent-like, but then it would “morph” into a jet black with absolutely no plasma look to it.  It did not look like it was “made of matter” in the sense that we usually perceive matter. I am somewhat shocked because I am a hard sceptic of almost any phenomena reported on any subject.  I called the airport.  They said that they know of nothing in the sky, that there is a National Guard Base nearby.  Really though, I’m not sure why I called them because this “object” did not look natural and moved in a very unnatural manner as well.  It was not a “vehicle” per se.  I am truly at a loss for words. I saw it earlier this week too, but it was very far away so I didn’t call or make a report because I wasn’t sure what I saw.  On that day, it seemed to hover in a completely still position and darted off at an extremely high speed.  I was intrigued as to what it could be, but it was very far away and pretty much a small, dark spot in the sky.

I would say it was at least three football fields wide and about a quarter of that long. There were five giant lights spaced at regular intervals from tip to tip (width) on the craft.

The spot where it was just looked many stars bunched together that are no longer there when you look at that general area.  *With how big the object was and how fast it was traveling, it should not have been able to stop that fast and that’s what made me first think that humans could not have made this.  The second craft appeared about 3 minutes after the first craft disappeared. It flew from the southeast and was descending. I would estimate the craft was about as wide as the wingspan of a commercial jet and about as long two football fields. It had a cylindrical fuselage. It had one green light near the front and two purple lights at the rear. The front sloped down from the main body of the craft and was lower than the rest of the craft as well. I heard no noise from the craft. It also stopped very quickly and disappeared. Just like the previous craft, the place where the craft stopped looked like a bunch of stars.

It was football shaped and glowing a fluorescent blue/green that was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  Although it was illuminating all around we could see it clearly without hurting our eyes.  We were only about 200 yards from it.

We were afraid it would come back and still felt its presence although we saw it shoot off and away.

Years later I looked up my girlfriend on Facebook and asked her about it.  She was amazed I brought it up but I wanted to make sure it wasn't something I mistook.  We talked about it for awhile but we both felt the fear again and stopped talking to each other altogether.  The fear of that thing we saw is still real.  I wish I could describe it better.

UFO REPORT:  On June 23, 2016, my buddy and I were talking outside the shop building where we work the night shift.  It was a clear night sky with stars visible everywhere.  I heard the jet engines of an airplane so I looked straight up and it was directly above me and it was being followed by a yellowish/orange light.  I said, “Holy ((deleted)), look at this!”   My buddy jumped out of the chair he was sitting in and looked up.  I said, “There’s a light following that airplane!”  He confirmed that he saw it too. I estimate the airplane was approximately at 20,000 feet.  I say this because normally when jets fly overhead at 40,000 feet by the time we hear them they are already past us and high enough up that all you can make out is the blinking lights.  This plane was low enough that I could see the outline of the plane itself, and as soon as I heard it I looked up and it was directly above us. The light was about the same size as the stars in the night sky and was following the plane at about two airplane lengths behind it, and did not appear to be attached to any other object as I could clearly see the stars without anything blocking them out in the background.  The light was not blinking and remained constant.   As we watched, the light appeared to move under and ahead of the airplane.  Then it got closer to and moved ahead of the plane, got closer to the front of the plane and moved ahead of it again several times. I looked at my fit bit and noted the time was 10:55 P.M. Mountain Standard time.  I also noted the plane and light were moving from east to west. After about 40 seconds of observing the plane and the light, my buddy noted that the airplane's navigation light began blinking.  Up until then we had not seen the lights on the plane blinking. I can’t say for certain, but I suspect the plane was a B-1 bomber flying out of Elsworth Air Force base from Rapid City.  They fly into our airport often and the roar of the engines are unmistakable.  This plane had a similar sound to the engines. After about one minute we lost sight of the plane and the light.

8,30,23,45 minutes,"Big balls of light in the sky darting around So, about 2 weeks ago, my husband and I went outside to let our dogs out.  It was probably 11:30pm.  We noticed these weird balls of light in the sky.  There was a light cloud cover and you could tell they were above the clouds.  At first, not knowing what we were seeing we thought maybe it was northern lights, but we were seeing weird balls of light zooming around because of the clouds??  So we got in our car and decided to drive down to a clearing, because we live in the woods, and see if we could see it better. So we drove about 2 miles down the road and parked at the clearing.  The lights were gone, and it was dead silent.  All of the sudden the lights appeared in front of our eyes and started moving around.  Sometimes they would blink, and sometimes seemed to move in a pattern together.  We thought someone was messing with us.  We could not believe what we were seeing!   Then all of the sudden.. one by one.. the balls formed into one big ball!. It sort of pulsed and just sat there in the sky for about 20 seconds. Then one by one the balls came out of the clouds and went down into the woods! NO JOKE!!! You could see a light beam coming down with each one of them, until they all went down into the woods, probably a quarter mile from our car.  I jumped in my car because I was terrified!  And sat there for a few seconds, then jumped back out and stood there and stared.  The whole time you couldn’t hear anything.   Then one by one the balls shot out of the woods back into the sky and sort of disa! ppeared.  I was so scared, and my husband was also, that we got in our car and started speeding home. We couldn’t believe what we saw.  On the way home they reappeared and almost followed us.  We got home, couldn’t see them, again everything was so still outside.  We went in, confused, and let the dogs back out.  They appeared again almost above our house. These lights, 5 of them, shooting around in the sky.  We took the dogs back in and went back out and just watched them.  They moved fast, sometimes together in weird ways, and blinked at times.  Finally I went in and came back out and they were gone. I have done tons of research and I see no natural ocurance that could explain this. There wasn’t any lightning that night.  What was weird also is that all the dogs out here in the woods were barking. You would hear them way off in the distance.  It was all just strange and mind boggling.  I did believe in UFO’s before this happened, but never in a million years did I expect to see something so strange. Well, I told the story to a few people, and then today, one of my friends I told messaged me and said there was a guy in the Kalispell, MT, yard sale, saying he had also saw something strange and was wondering if anyone else had seen anything weird in the sky. I’m tying to contact the guy now.   I know what I saw sounds completely unbelievable.  I don’t expect anyone to believe me!  I’d be willing to take a lie detector test on this!

When we got back to the car we were just relaxing in the air conditioning.  The car lights were acting funny and kept shutting off every now and then.  I noticed a small drop of light moving through the trees and was trying to figure out if it was a lightning bug or a plane, but I never could be sure.  This was nothing compared to what we eventually saw.  We got out of the car with our flashlights and we were just goofing around.  All of a sudden, my friend calls my attention, “come here! look! Look!”  I was completely spellbound by this object.  I kept checking myself to make sure I was not crazy and we kept reassuring each other.  I was very curious and without fear as the object swarmed around the tree tops.  My friend was yelling at me to get back in the car because he was terrified.  I don’t know what would have happened if I continued to welcome the craft.  I did not feel like it wanted to do me harm, but I just felt overwhelmed.  It seemed like the more I welcomed it, the more it moved towards me and became more noticeable.  It was an orb with a revolving disc around it that was covered in lights, and it moved without any noise, and so elegantly.  It was so intricate that it is hard to describe.  It moved in all directions, stopping and changing speed.  It even followed us out to the main road and stopped when we stopped and kept observing us.  It was the most amazing experience I have ever had.  I am not a crazy person.  I know what I saw, but I don’t know what it was.

On our way there, we saw a very large plum of smoke rising into the sky, like something massive was on fire.  When we arrived I noticed it was still coming up from the ground, so I took a picture and sent it to my mother, asking if she had heard on the news of anything burning.  She checked our local news website and found nothing, saying it might have been a controlled burn.  When I looked at the picture I noticed a series of strange lights hovering over the smoke.

There is an airport close to this area, but behind where I am taking the picture from.  The only thing in the area of the picture is a lot of woods and some small residential neighborhoods.

It was extremely clear outside and I seen the jet coming along ways before it finallly passed over.  The direction it flew from was WSW to NE.  Illustrationally speaking for a mental image, a flight path from Dallas, Texas, to New York City. As the jet neared closer, I noticed an odd object behind it.  I didn't think much of it until it got closer.  The jet didn't pass directly over me, it probably was (roughly) an eighth of a mile South. As it got closer to passing over, I noticed the object trailing about (roughly) a half mile behind it, on the exact same path, flying at about the same speed.  I was in T- Total shock! I watched both the jet and then the silver/grey disk-shaped object fly of towards the North-East.  Nothing abnormal happened, no erratic movements, no lights, and no sound.

I had looked over and saw some thing that looked like an ember floating and pointed it to my neighbor.  We stood and looked and it got larger and brighter.  It was coming from the South headed North.  As we watched it turned East and we watched as it got in the distance and faded away.  It was about as high as the tree tops and we saw no sign of any lights that would mark a plane or helecopter.  It made no noise at all. My neighbor went in and I moved to my back yard to watch and again I saw a fire ball of Orange color following the same patn.  I ran and knocked on my other neighbors door and he came out to see. It was very much like what we had seen several months.  AMAZING.

7,4,22,7-8 minutes,"Four lights hover in sky, followed by fireballs circulating the night sky. My eleven-year old son was watching fireworks from our back deck when he called me (his mom) and dad outside because he saw some lights. I didn’t think much about it because it was the fourth of July; however, he pointed out four unusual red/orange lights that hovered in unison from the east to west direction.  Our back deck faces north. It was peculiar to see these lights drifting slowly from east to west against the night sky when there were plenty of fireworks.  The first three set of lights were in a triangle shape with the fourth trailing behind. We then called our oldest 17-year old son to see these lights and ask what he thought about them. Shortly after he came to see them we noticed that the first three set of lights in a triangle shape lost the first bottom left light, as it simply disappeared.  Our 17-year old also agreed how odd the lights appeared. We noticed some airplanes to the southeast of us, and we could slightly hear their engines.  The light! s hovered together and kept in the same distance for some time.  The lights began to trail behind a set of trees and as we moved to see if we could see them we noticed that the remaining two from the triangle disappeared, but the last trailing light remained. My eleven-year old son and I went further into the east section of our yard to see the light before it completely went behind the trees, but when we saw it it disappeared.  There was no noise or and sound with this object, and of course we could hear some loud booms from the fireworks in the sky.  My husband and I had not drunk any alcohol or anything like that and had just finished a cup of coffee when we saw this.  So we were very awake and aware of what was occurring. Later about 22:40, we saw something that looked like fireballs in the sky.  These “flames” looked like balls or firedrops hovering slowly in a circular pattern in the nightsky, which was interesting against the fireworks exploding in the sky. These lights a! ppeared to be observing. I went inside and grabbed my binocula! rs to lo ok at these objects. One in particular was unusually close and through the lens of the binoculars it still just looked like a firelight, but smaller?  We (my husband and I) carefully observed it to see whether it was a helicopter or an airplane of some sort take pictures of the fireworks. We are aware that aircraft taking pictures of fireworks is not unusual this time of year, yet we dismissed this possibility when they did not closely resemble aircraft.

3,3,1,15 sec,"I was on my roof last night in Kansas City's Westbottem's and I was out there for the purpose to catch a UFO on camera.  It was still early since I figured it would maybe happen, a sighting I mean, at about 3 am the witching hour.  Well to my surprise I was laying there playing guitar for about an hour straight, all alone laying on my back looking up at the almost full moon.  Well the moon was sort of in the west at this point but I sat up and put my guitar down and I saw three oval shaped craft with no light's flying in formation from south to north towards the old downtown airport. The ships looked maybe brown but really stood out, against the clear night sky about 300 or so feet above me.  They flew in such a way that it looked like one craft, and there was a jitter effect on one of the oval shaped craft like tracer but they were not moving that fast maybe 100 to 200 miles an hour.   The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 seconds enough time for me to blink a couple of times. I found it strange because to start the night of I looked at the sky and said in my head LIVE  TO LOVE AND LOVE TO LIVE LIFE which is my sort of meditation words, and as soon as I was done playing guitar they flow over, it scared the shit out of me I called my dad and he instructed me to get off the roof so I did but remained at my roof hatch for the rest of the night with camera in hand but I was to late.  I am going to make it a point to be up there every night till I get footage. Good luck on your quest I am both scared a bit excited to help you with your journey, I have always believed but now my life has changed because I know.  Thank you for doing this the world needs to wake up and see what has been hidden, I was thinking about my statistic's class in collage which I went to but It was art collage, any way the chances of me catching eye of a UFO on my first night and the fact that they flow over me very low to the ground lower then a normal helicopter even it seemed, are almost impossible.  People spend there whole life looking and never see, my only conclusion is the power of the mind is a very special thing that many do not realise or they noticed that I enjoy life or, sorry, they liked my music. About me, well I am in my mid twenty's and am trying to start a Animation Studio.

I was sitting in my bed talking online to a friend on a laptop in front of me and had the TV running to my left. I sensed something and looked up.  A sphere that appeared to be metal and about the size of a softball was flying into my bedroom from out in the hallway (in front of me to the right).  It flew about arms length in front of me.  It did not have wings or rotors that I could see, but it flew and maneuvered as a helicopter would.  I did not hear any noise from it.  I didn’t see any windows, etc., but it must have had some type of sensors.  It turned by pivoting in its space and started to fly away toward the wall in front of me.  I thought it might have been some sort of police spybot, but I had no idea how it would have entered my house or why. I wasn’t dreaming.  I was wide awake with lights and noise from the TV and typing on the laptop and the light happened to be on in the hallway.  It was a completely physical experience, until it flew right through the wall of my bedroom.

7,25,22,1 hour,"Solid white lights crossing the sky at a very high altitude at a very rapid speed. Let me first start by saying, I found this site by stumbling on it while trying to find answers to what my son & I witnessed and have witnessed in the past. My son is a 10 year old curious young man who has questions about everything.  So it was no surprise that he would have questions about the lights in the sky that we witnessed together. I myself am a 47 year old male who has experienced some really odd and unexplainable stuff in my life after spending 21 years in the military and serving 13 years as a uniformed police office and 2 years under cover.  I’ve seen just about all the weird stuff, I want to in my life. On July 25, 2012, at approximately 21:00 hours, while fishing in a lake on our property, I observed a solid white light crossing the sky from southwest to northeast.  I pointed the light out to my son, who by far has better eye sight than I do.  The light was so far up that if you didn’t track it, you would lose sight of it.  The light appeared to be moving at a fairly rapid speed as that of a jet plane, but with no flashing lights, the altitude was much higher than what an aircraft could travel. My son & I continued to observe three more lights over the next hour traveling in the same direction at the same speed, matching the same description as the one before it. If it’s a UFO, interesting, if it’s plane or satellite great, we are just looking for answer to what it is.  I have seen these same lights in the sky before, but in another location with my old son who was about 13 at the time. These lights are not something notice by walking out the door of your house and looking up in the night sky.  I’ve only noticed them when concentrating on the night sky in a very dark area without much interference light from surrounding homes.  I don’t think you would notice them unless you are looking for them.

7,4,0,15 seconds,"Light I can't identify in North Missouri sky I was standing outside, smoking a cigarette and looking at the (nearly full) moon.  A large tree blocked most of my view of the sky to the left of the moon.  Through the tree branches I noticed a very large, bright ""star"", or so I thought at first.  I moved several feet away from the tree to get a better look.  ""What a big star!"", I thought.  ""I wonder if that is a planet, maybe mars, that is closer than normal.  But I've seen mars many times and it's never THAT big.""  It was big and roughly circular, though hard to tell the shape because it was bright.  After looking at it for a few seconds I saw it start moving.  It was a sort of dirty orange or orangish-brown color.  More orange than brown, but not a neon orange.  It did not blink or pulsate at any time.   I've never seen aircraft with lights of that color and aircraft lights usually blink.  When it started moving I at first thought maybe it was some sort of sattelite that was! very close.  But then it didn't move in a straight line.  This was definitely not a meteor or an airplane.  I doubt a helicopter could have moved the way it did, and again, I've never seen helicopter lights this color or helicopter lights that don't blink.  There would be no reason for a helicopter to move in this fashion and I've never seen a helicopter move this way, though I suppose it might be possible.  A helicopter is the only craft I know of that can fly in a non-linear way like this.  Also, I never heard a helicopter noise, or any other noise during this sighting.   After roughly 15 seconds of watching it, the craft ""disappeared"" (hard to describe).  It seemed as though it flew away from me (not to the right or left, but directly away from me) and sort of looked smaller as it did so.  This happened quickly.  I was left wondering what I saw and if anyone else saw it and if there was anything I could or should do.   I stood around looking all over the sky for! a while to see if it would reappear and so far it hasn't (I'm! typing this about an hour after I saw it).  I was hoping it would come back so I could be ready with my cellphone camera.   I should also note that there were a lot of fireworks earlier in the night, but this was definitely NOT a firework.  There was no noise, it could fly any direction it wanted or stay stationary for a few seconds at a time.

7,17,22,10 min,"4 orange flaming lights traveling south to north with 8-9 loud booms, and flashs to the north of our location. At 10:20 PM Saturday 7/17/2010, I was sitting in bed on my laptop online when I heard a loud boom outside.  Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me. The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction. Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes. My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house. We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during. The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level. During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms.  I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind. Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.

Our dogs start barking defensively, which is not super odd, but then my boyfriend started shouting for me to come look at something. So I was very scared right away.  An orange-red, fire-like, or glowing, orb came from the north over the tree line, and then over our house, and continued towards Lake Superior.   We both could tell it was low in the sky because we had ran outside to watch.  He described it like he thought it was a drone, but it was too glowy, fast, and noise-less to be a drone, we agreed afterwards.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.   We watched the thing as it got farther away and it stopped and slowly faded, but did not disappear.  It then started to blink green and red light.   After the shock of first seeing this thing come over us, we saw 2 other odd objects in the sky.  It was a very large triangle formation they had all made and all 3 were doing the same blinking.  One was way to the northeast; the one we saw flying was souteast, and a third almost directly east, but higher in the sky to make the tip of the triangle....  Shortly after watching and then noticing the formation, a plane began approaching, and looked to be heading directly for it, but ended up below/south, but kept going past.

8,16,23,14-16 minutes,"In late August, 1999, my wife and I were staying at a cabin on the ridge overlooking Lake Superior just outside Grand Marais, Minnesota. I t was an exceptionally clear evening with a view of the Milky Way stretching across the sky at about 11:00 P.M.-11:30 P.M.  I had just stepped outside onto a small deck of the cabin with a clear view of the lake and ridgeline and was looking towards the town of Grand Marais.  Suddenly, I felt as if someone was standing behind me and I turned around to see what was going on. I saw a large circular shape of concentrated white light, without a halo, larger than a full moon, about five to ten miles away above the ridgeline and not obstructed in any way.  My first thought was that it was a very large meteor but it was stationary without movement. My next thought was that it might be some kind of aircraft but I quickly dismissed that idea.  This initial observation of the object lasted about 8-10 minutes.  Then, within the white ligh! t, at about 2/3rds of the inside diameter, a bright red ring of light developed in a clockwise fashion. This internal red ring was maintained for several more minutes and then vanished.  Next, the overall white circular light contracted to where the red ring had appeared.  Then this object suddenly and at great speed ascended at about an 85 degree angle towards the north without a sound. I watched the ascent of the object to where it was about the size of a small star and watched it travel at high speed some distance and over the horizon, heading north over Canada.  Besides the physical visual experience, what also stood out about the encounter was the very strong sense of presence of the object.  I have never seen anything like this in my life before or since. I have no explanation of it and it was clearly not a natural phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At 21:15, 9:15 PM, driving home on county Road 11, above a hill at the highest point on my route north back home I saw a bright red light.  Originally with the air traffic from MSP I was expecting an aircraft of some sort. At about 130th street I was able to better make out the object and saw no other running lights, which aroused my interest.  The object was about the speed of a light plane and continued changing the observation angle to the point where I was directly under it. It was round with no appendages.  The outer edges of the object were a dark red and the object was an increasingly brighter red toward it's center.  There was a bright white light in the center which varied from very bright to much less so. I saw this object while I traveled 3/4 mile at 40 mph and it crossed from my right front to overhead and to my rear in that time.  It crossed my line of sight going into trees.  It was no higher than 500 feet in my estimation, steady in that elevation and by reconsidering my positions on a map it was traveling to the South-SouthWest, against the reported breeze from the South.  It was 5 to 8 feet in diameter if its elevation was 500 feet, proportionally greater if higher in elevation.  It was sharp and distinct when seen closer and especially when it was directly overhead.   Total time of the observation was about 45 seconds.  This was just after sunset with cloudy skies.  I had two cameras with me, shame on me for not stopping and trying to grab a picture, or two. Conventional explanation seems limited to a balloon flare but the object was going against a light, but prevailing breeze. With many people out on the Fourth looking at fireworks, some kind of balloon drone combination would have to be considered too. But that is if one needs to find a conventional explanation.","Low flying starlike orbs in urban area, triangle formation make for the sky silently at at unseen speeds",BURNSVILLE,MN,SPHERE,2014,0.374552053,0.629104821,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,0.44357507,0,0,NA,0.373899236,0,-0.493997258,0,NA,SSE,CLEAR

I was outside in my driveway in roughly 2011 (forgive me as it has been a couple of years so I do not exactly remember the year, since I didn't lend much credence to it at the time), but, I happened to look up in the sky and saw 3 different 6-triangle shaped lights moving VERY FAST across the sky.  There were NO Red & Green lights that would indicate any aircraft.  I live near an airport so I am used to seeing airplanes flying either overhead or very near my sightline.  These were simply white lights.  These lights were moving so fast that I literally didn't have enough time to grab my cell phone to record them moving.  There are NO aircraft that move THAT FAST! ,  Plus, I have seen the pictures of the SAME lights that I saw, but, what I saw, there was a group of 2 sets of those lights that over-lapped each other.  Meaning, and looking up and moving West to East, and number the lights from front to back, and left to right, 1 first row, 2-3 second row, 4-5-6 third row, when you see the first set of 6 lights, the second 6-set of lights were in synch, but,  the 2nd row of lights (light #2) overlapped the original 3rd set of lights at light number 6.

It continued moving in a ""floating"" side to side pattern as it seemed to slowly lose its vibrant light and disappear after heading in the direction for about two minutes.  It was small in the sky but still dwarfed many of the stars and could be 10-20 combined in the sky.  It gave off a good amount of light until the end when it slowly faded out.

My family and I (in all 12 people, 9 adults & 3 children) were sitting out by the fireside no one drinking ...(yet). We were watching the fire and talking about all the things that a family talks about; when abruptly my brother says ""hay what is that ""? (being the prankster he has always been)  I thought I was going to turn and see something comical... when I turned I saw an object that was a red / Orange color, oscillating light moving across the crystal clear, calm, Moon lit night (winds aloft were out of the west as would become evident about 45 min. later when some Alto Cyrus clouds rolled in). I was sitting looking to the North, He was to my right and looking West when he sighted the object which was tracking South to North, sort'a following the lake shore. It came up from behind me and moved across the sky slightly west of our over head vantage-point. We all re-in-acted the event right away to get the length of time, we agreed that it took between 90-120 seconds to traverse the portion of the sky,  keeping in mind the trees behind and in front of us (his property is in a clearing). I said right away ""this is not an asteroid or meteor because it was not moving east to west, but South to North"".  Every one was taken ""a-back"" it appeared to have a constant oscillation, there was no erratic behavior about it as it moved silently across the sky. It is so hard to tell the altitude it was at, you know, is it slow small and low? or is it large fast and high? my guess is large, moderately fast and high it seemed to move slower than the Space Station... my daughter said she thought it was tumbling and that she could make out a dark shadowy ""organic shape"" to it, and the red orange light looked like the light from Tungsten lights she works with (I know that I focused on the direction and the light not looking at the whole object so much). My Brothers daughter took 4 pic's of the light on her camera phone, and I am going to forward them to whom ever I need to. The light from the object sorta faded out kind of like it passed our field of view because as it faded I could see a gray shape that was still visible as it moved along.  I would say that it would be analogise to driving by a traffic light for parallel street with a crossing (only much larger, Much Larger!) with the Sun Screen (bonnet or hood... what ever you call it?) this would allow you to see a faint amount of light to an ever increasing amount then to it's zenith followed by an ever decreasing amount till it was no longer visible but you can still see the traffic light, all while oscillating.",Lighted train flies across night sky.

Flying objects that were silent As I went out in to my driveway, I looked up to see some fireworks going off when I saw an Orange light just hanging there. I thought at first it was a firework, due to its firey orange color, that had reached its peak height and was ready to explode. Instead of explode though I noticed it was moving south, towards me, at a slow pace maybe 30-40mph.    After I realized it was flying I watched it for a minute then ran in and grabbed my video camera and got the wife.  As we watched it fly overhead and right past us the orange glow just faded out.   At that time we both looked back north and noticed another one coming.  This one did the exact same thing.  It flew south then slowly faded out.  This happened two more times.   These objects seemed to be following each other at a distance.  One every 2-3 mins apart.  The great thing about the night of the 4th was that it was a clear night and even after the lights faded we should have still been able to see the shape of the objects due to the fact the sky was so clear and we could see the stars.   I'm not sure what they were but as I said the were a bright firey orange color and were roughly 2000 feet high and completely silent.  They didn't make a sound! I see and hear planes go over all the time since I live about 5 miles S.E. from DTW.  These were NOT planes and were not on the flight route of the planes that land or take off.   These objects looked as if they were following Inkster rd due south and veered east over Lake Erie.  I found these same objects on youtube when I typed in UFO's of July 4th.  As far as my video went.  The video quality was terrible.  Trying to record and object like that at night is harder then I thought it would be. I'm not a UFO nut I and my wife work for GM and have no history of seeing things and can explain almost all of what I see in the skys.

8,26,20,2-3 minutes,"One birght and three dark UFOs seen in the skies over Cadillac, Michigan I was taking pictures outside tonight, around 8:30 pm on August 26th, 2007. There were some odd cloud formations that I thought would be cool to post as stock on my Deviant Art account. I got a few pictures of some planes with their vapor trails from the cooling weather and when I looked over into the eastern part of the southern sky, I saw something odd. There was a very bright object in the sky, about the size of a large blimp, moving slowly through the sky. I say it was odd because not only was it so bright compared to the planes I had been photographing, but it also had no vapor trail. None of the other planes were without one. So I took a few pictures of it. I should have clicked my camera, a Nikon Coolpix 4200 to video, but I wasn't sure what I was seeing. I watched it for about 2 minutes, then went inside to tell my wife and mother about it. I was only inside maybe 15-20 seconds. When I stepped back out it had gone. At the original rate it was moving, had it held constant, it shouldn't have gone very far in that time. And if it was a plane, it should still have been in view in the areaI was looking in. But there was nothing. I went back inside and began looking at the pictures. The first one I looked at had everyone blinking in shock. As I zoomed in you could see the object, no vapor trail visible, and you could see from the light reflecting on it that it was ROUND! It looked like a big, silvery inner tube. I checked the other pictures out and all but one was too fuzzy to make out. As I went to crop one of the other pictures so you could get a better view of it, my hand slid wrong and enlarge the picture in a space above the UFO I was trying to crop. And I froze. My heart actually skipped a beat. In the sky above the bright UFO were 3 more dark objects. One was larger than the other and at an angle, with two smaller ones below it. I have cropped these with the bright UFO, and then separately so you can have an understanding of the perspective. The photos were taken in Cadillac, Michigan.

6,30,21,15 minutes,"Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks. Yesterday (September 9, 2014) I was watching a bunch of UFO shows on direct TV and they mentioned your organization.  Up to this point I did not know there was a place to report UFO sightings. My wife and I lived in Manitou Beach, Michigan between June 1998 and July 2002.  I believe it was the fall of 1998 when I had an experience with an unidentified flying object.   I drove from my house on Devils Lake Hwy to Brooklyn, Michigan, in the evening to pick up some Chinese food for supper.  Returning home, I drove south out of Brooklyn and drove down Brooklyn Rd., which runs next to MIS (Michigan International Speedway).  When I arrived at the corner of Brooklyn Road and US12 I saw an object in the night sky which appeared to be approximately above Round Lake Highway.   I pulled off the road at the corner and sat in my car watching the object.  The object appeared to be the size of a basketball, it changed colors from yellow, to orange, to blue on the perimeter and appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object moved extremely slow and ran parallel to US 12, moving from the west to the east, and the object was approximately 100 feet above the tree line.  I watched this object for approximately 15 minutes and it maintained the same height, never changing its altitude. I served in the United States Navy and US Army National Guard.  The object had characteristics of a flare with some notable differences.  Flares do not maintain their altitude and fall to the ground diagonally unless there is a strong wind - and there was no wind.   I thought about a meteor but the item moved much to slow.  I tried to put a rational explanation as to what I was seeing in the night sky but came up empty.   At this point, I had worked for the Michigan Department of Corrections in Parole/Probation for over 10 years, and believe I’m a confident observer.  I watched the item from the time it was over Round Lake Highway until it had moved on its easterly course until it had probable passed over M50, at which time I decided to head for home, but the object continued on an easterly course at the same height and continued to follow US 12. The though crossed my mind that I was witnessing an Unidentified Flying Object, which alarmed me to some degree, but I thought the item was small to be a flying saucer and, unless they have a shrink ray, there would be no way for the object to abduct me or beam me aboard.   I thought the object might be a probe, but the only significant land mark in the area is Michigan International Speedway.  I should also note there are no military installations in the area and there was no events taking place at Michigan International Speedway, so there was no reasons for a flare to be in the night sky.   I’m extremely confident that what I saw was not a flare of any type and that’s why I’m writing to you to report an unidentified flying object.  If we had cell phones with cameras back then, I would have loved to have taken a photograph of the object because it was really interesting.  This is the first time I’ve told anyone of the incident with the exception of my wife and kids. Throughout the shows that I watched I did not see any reports of UFO’s matching the description of the item that I saw but found the vast array and variety of spacecraft reported which makes me wonder if we’re not being visited by various entities, and then that brings up the logical question - why?  DNA samples, intelligence gathering, mapping, scientific studies by entities visiting our planet lead me to the question of intention.  While I was in the National Guard I served as an intelligence analyst for awhile and it was my job to evaluate potential threats and create counter measures.  Time after time I have seen on the shows about UFO’s visiting earth where the spacecraft have been around military installations and other vital infrastructure around the world.  Often we hear a comparison between technological differences and how earthlings are new to the cosmic scope and how entities visiting earth are so much more advanced - but then there are reports of so many cra! shed space ships.  Even in our infancy we have gps, collision alarms for aircraft (and cars now), and a host of other technological devices - so it seems rational to believe any advanced entity would also have these items so I’m not sure why there would be so many crashed spaceships. In closing:  I believe in what I see with my own eyes.  I cannot put a rational explanation to what I saw (which does not mean there is not a rational explanation).  Even if I had not experienced an unidentified flying object I believe there is life beyond earth just as a matter of chance - as a gambler you play the odds and if you look into the heavens you would have to be ignorant to believe we are alone.  I think it is shameful UFO sighting are not taken seriously by governments around the world because as an intelligence analyst you need data in order to reach conclusions and to come up with logical responses.  I graduated from Western Michigan University with a double major - Criminal Justice/Sociology, which means I like to collect evidence, look at it and draw my own conclusions.  I also like to study people and societies and cannot help but wonder why some societies seem to have more experiences with other entities then others and wonder what significance this ph! enomenon has in the larger picture.

Recently I saw something unexplainable, on March 24th, at approx. 8:30pm, I was in Waldorf, Maryland, driving on Mattawoman-Beantown Rd in moderate snowfall, when I saw lights that appeared to be a small plane landing with its landing lights and I saw a red blinking light, although I thought I was weird because there is no airport near there, as I drove further up the road I noticed that it was hovering and not flying, I thought surely its a helicopter and I must have mistook the search light for landing lights.  As we drove under the object, I could clearly see a Black Triangle with three red lights on the bottom that alternated flashing in a clockwise motion, no two light were on simultaneously, also there was a light at each corner that resembled a car's headlights but searching in a sweeping motion.

The first thing I noticed is that it was completely silent and rather high in the sky. I am close to two airports, also two hospitals.  I've watched many planes and helicopters over our area for the past 18 years but, this object seemed much higher in the sky than most planes that fly over.  I saw the object fly approximately from the south to the north for a few seconds then come to a complete stop. The object sat in one spot allowing me to get a good look at it. It was white and triangular in shape with three red spots(not lights) on the belly of it. There did not appear to be any sign of a rear exhaust or any lights on the object.  After sitting in that spot for maybe five seconds the object shot off to the north at a speed I've have never seen any aircraft move and totally disappeared as if it had flown out of the atmosphere and into space.

They were making a distinct patterns, first forming the shape of a cross then gathering in the middle then going outward and making more shapes.

We drove out of the city and off into a farm field where there were no lights around so we could see the stars clearly.  It was difficult at first to actually see the stars because it was a cloudy night and we were only 15 minutes away from the bright lights of the city.  As we searched for Andromeda, we all started commenting on the orange light that hung right above our horizon dew North.  The light appeared to be moving, but after a few minutes we agreed it was still and that it could possibly be a radio tower or fixated light of some sort. We tried to get a closer look with my telescope but all we could make out was a grainy, orange glow. (Definitely in the shape a circle- we were able to see the shape with our telescope set at 25x) I attempted to use my phone to zoom in on the object but it was still blurry so I just gave up.  In our opinion it was not a star because it was so close to our horizon and the brightness of the city wouldn’t have allowed us to see a star that low.  It was lower than any observable star in the sky. The clouds South of us were moving in so quickly that we could literally watch them roll over the horizon covering the stars.  We got distracted by this and turned around for a second, when we turned back around the object was completely gone.  We did see a plane flying through the sky (at about the same altitude) but it was definitely not the same object because it had a red blinking light and it was definitely a plane. After we all realized that the object was gone we got such an eerie sensation that we just had to get out of there.  We decided to drive down the road a little bit to make sure it wasn’t a radio tower with an orange light on it- we drove a mile and realized there was no tower, still feeling afraid we turned around and booked it back to the city.

6,12,1,seconds,"green glowing circle shooting across sky and nightly white light I have always had a habit of watching the skies at night.  The best sightings I had were when I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe. The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it. I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. ""the light""   it is like the stars are pin-heads and “the light” is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line – it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night – but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don’t go out there when it is raining.

It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist.

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Café and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well. I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen. After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at. My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place. When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun. I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere. The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don’t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.

12,19,12,~1 minute,"Silent black composit aircraft with red-tinted dome near front. Heavily cloudy day with low hanging clouds, and they were moving in the direction as all witnessed aircraft.  The size of the craft was well seen, it was bright out, and was no more than one and a half ""medium to large"" oak trees tall.  Thus, the craft was off the ground no more than five stories. The aircraft itself was silent, and had a few lights.  While I forget the colors (I want to say blue and red) and their exact placement.  The aircraft was absolutely silent and had a black exterior which was probably its material and not paint.  The aircraft had no markings of any country.  The only company that has the ability to use the airspace within this area is Northrop.  They do not mark test aircraft. At its front end this craft had large, red hued dome protruding from its bottom, similar to a UAV camera dome.  This may have housed a IR camera that was testing therm-imaging designed for use through cloud cover (see DARPA current special projects' webpage).   There may have been antenna housed therein, as other aircraft designs has such domes as containing communication/monitoring antenna.  It did not appear to have any heat trails, but the fast moving clouds around it that day made it hard to observe and distinguish (if any).  There were around four to eight rectangles in the back of the craft, and was probably of a rotatory motor design.  While there was certainly enough room for a person to potentially be inside, from my vantage point it did not seem like there was even standing room in the mid-area of the plane.  I did not get to view the top of the craft, nor did it had have anything like tail-end rudders. The craft was shockingly low to the ground and had zero to nearly zero sound.  If it was not for a cloud break, myself looking up, it would have remained unnoticed.  The craft's wingspan was around the size of four to five standard street lanes.  It was moving rather quickly compared to ground cars that preceded it, maybe around 40-60 miles per hour?  There were no cars on the ground, and it was traversing the streets above homes, rather than flying along main streets.  The direction was headed toward Baltimore Washington Airport.

No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.

3,12,22,15-25 seconds,"9:24 PM I know it was because Gadget made it very clear we had to take one more walk in the park before bedtime. Reluctantly I took him out the back and over to Patterson Park.  It was a crystal clear night, very pleasant weather and only 1 or 2 other dog walkers out.  As we rounded the Pagoda on the home leg of our walk I was looking south and could clearly see the constellation Orion just off to the SSW.  I remember saying to myself, ""So clear, I’ll bet I can see Taurus  (my Zodiacal sign).""  Started to swing my head to the west and out of the corner of my eye, approaching from the south, I saw something I cannot explain. At least 9 amber/orange lights in formation and 3 or 4 more lights not in formation, meandering around the formation, were rapidly moving across the sky from almost due south to due north.  I was dumbfounded.  I observed this for about 15-20 seconds. The formation consisted of 3 v-shaped flights in a chevron that was rock solid, all flew in unison.  The meanderers seemed to circle and wander around the solid chevron as they tore across the sky at incredible speed. Flabbergasted, I muttered a few expletives.  Trying to get a grip on myself I struggled to get my phone out but just as it cleared my jacket pocket the phenomenon disappeared over the horizon to the north. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park saw this.  There was nobody around except Gadget who, sensing my astonishment, looked at me with concern as if to say, “What’s up with you, ((name deleteed))?  Why so frantic?”  Completely blown away we stood there for a few moments.  I Goggled the number and called in the report to UFOReports.com right there from the park. Bewildered we walked home and I made an online report of the sighting. I tried to explain it to myself most of the rest of the night. Was it reflections of street lights off my glasses?  Their color was similar to sodium vapor street lighting.  No I surmised.  I had to swivel my head from south to north to track the lights and they never wavered in their flight path.  Arrow straight the formation flew, no wavering or smearing you would expect if it was a reflection. Space junk?  Maybe, but the formation was so solid the flight appeared to be on an intentional course.  And to have 9 lights in solid formation and 3 or for in a seemingly random formation is a mix of trajectories and not likely to be a single object that broke up on reentry.  Such junk would all follow the same path and would leave a trail of some sort.  There was no flaming trail. Aircraft?  I've never seen anything move that fast in the atmosphere.  I've seen satellites, the ISS, Skylab, these moved just as fast if not faster across the sky.  The meandering lights also seemed to take a non-ballistic course and moved in ways no aircraft I know of could reproduce. So, there you have it.

For an additional 25 minutes all occupants of my vehicle watched as the lights danced and pulsed brightly then faded, then getting bright again, all while dancing through the clouds.  We took a short video of the lights and several photos. The lights in total had a large circular shape, but the lights appeared to be moving in binary groupings. There were at least 20 individual lights, grouped into at least 10 pairings.  While parked the lights faded and the cloud appeared to grow dark grey in a large oval shape.

I first noticed an unusual glowing orange shape in the sky, perhaps a few thousand feet above the roof of the club, about 80 degrees above the horizon.  I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was. My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing. The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon. Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair. I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone's camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye. At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.

8,13,0,2-3 minutes,"orange light comes down, changes, turns, takes off I was driving my friend home.  I went straight through the center of town and down South Main St., heading towards her street when I noticed a bright orange light in the sky, over the street on the right side of the road, just to the left of and slightly above the trees lining parts of the street.  I laughed and mentioned it to her, joking that maybe it was one of my dad's meteors (my dad had come home from work that night complaining that he had wanted to watch the meteors but it was too cloudy to see anything).  I also jokingly asked if she thought the insurance would cover it if it hit the car because it appeared to be descending fairly quickly.  I asked her if it looked like it was coming down and she said it sure did.  It was orange, similar in size and color to some of the street lamps in town but it was, at first, higher in the sky than the street lamps.  And as it got wat I believe to be lower, it also got slightly bigger. This friend and I have seen strange things in the past, one of which I also have reported to NUFORC (11/1/95, Randolph, ""Light appears over power lines"").  And this was in the same area.  So I decided to drive down the same street we saw the other light.  Partly because I wanted to see if there may have been others by those power lines again and partly because I wanted to get off the main road so I could stop safely.  So I took a right and quick left to a parallel street and we still saw the light (so at this point I can be sure it was not a street light - with the trees and houses between the two streets it would be impossible).  I stopped the car in the middle of the street and we watched as the object got a bit lower and then turned sharply to our left (object's right).  At that point, my friend said, somewhat disappointed, ""Oh, I think it's a plane."" And it kind of looked like airplane lights then, because the orange light had ""gone out"" as it turned and was replaced by ! 2 or 3 white lights, and it was traveling horizontally to our left instead of down.  Then, it turned again, sharply, heading away from us, going either back (kind of West, the direction we had been heading and were aimed at) or up, I couldn't really tell but it was moving.  So I started driving towards the end of the street, intending to get back on the main road to follow the object.  I had to take a left and then a quick right to get back the way we had been before (S. Main St. again) and I was driving as fast as I safely could because we lost sight of it.  When we got on the main road it was nowhere to be seen.  My friend had her face up against the windshield, trying to look up and around and neither of us could see anything.  I drove up the street a way and pulled into a parking lot and we looked.  Nothing anywhere.  And it was dead quiet too.  I got back on the road and drive my friend home (we had passed her house in our efforts to follow this thing).  I got out of t! he car at her house to look around a bit more but there was st! ill noth ing. It was not a helicopter because a helicopter that close would have made noise and there was no noise.  And it did not maneuver like any airplane I have ever seen though when it ""became"" the white lights, it did kind of resemble airplane lights.  But the orange light was nothing I have seen on an airplane and we literally watched it go from one large orange light to 2 or 3 smaller white lights.  It definitely wasn't a meteor because of the movement (unless meteors change direction abruptly twice in the span of seconds and change looks the way I described). My friend and I are both in our 30's and were not drinking or on drugs.

On April 12th, 2014, in Quincy, MA (near Wollostan Beach), I witnessed a spectacular event, to which I have no explanation. I first witnessed 3 distinct orange orbs in a triangular formation that soon became dispersed in a very subtle, and fading in and out-floating way.  I honestly thought I was just seeing things, but decided to grab my Ipad and record the following event:  Recorded via Ipad(although unfortunately, 10 times illegible versus the naked eye) I was noticing multiple reddish-orange orbs pulsating and maneuvering at odd trajectories.  They were lighting up the sky- many many many of them!  It was as though some of them would hover and some would skip in the sky.  Sometimes leaving visual traces of their flight paths….. Some would hover, some would move in right angles and zip amongst the sky, some were pulsating, some were moving in what appeared to be in formation- sometimes forming distinct geometric patterns, some flashing in and out of focus, some turning slightly different colors- such as green-amber glows, etc. That very night, the moon had a very peculiar glow and a mist or cloud formation that took on the shape of a beautiful circle of clouds or something equivalent. Just so you know, I am an artist and an art professor at a respectable college, and my eyes are very keen to subtlety.  I honestly thought that most of what I was seeing was perhaps due to retinal fatigue, but when I went inside after the orange orbs, I decided to Ipad-video record this event.

When I looked to the right of the birds I noticed what I thought were two other birds circling each other at a great rate of speed, but I realized that they were much too high in the sky to be birds.

8,6,14,10 seconds,"Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow. On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead. At first glance I thought it was some kid's silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I'm estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it. After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, ""Look up!"" to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone. I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don't want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don't think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn't be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO.",It was a boomerang shaped object that had faded rainbow color and went around it self in circles and changed altitude once in a while.,PEABODY,MA,DISK,2010,-2.038546458,1.487292996,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,0.302385412,0,0,NA,1.836979716,0,-1.683127711,0,0.583362,WEST,PARTLY CLOUDY

He couldn't zero in on the object fast enough to get a good look but I got it on video for the duration of the event. Right away, we both thought it was a drone, but when it traversed such a great distance at a relatively fast speed we were convinced it was not a drone.  There were no aviation lights on the craft, and it was a dark orange in color; it almost had a pearl type glow to it. Meaning the color kind of had a swirl to it.  It was shaped sort of like an egg on it's side.  There was no noise and it appeared to be pretty close and low in the sky although it was difficult to tell with no clouds to judge altitude.

8,8,10,20 minutes,"Daytime contact with an UFO I was in the Coast Guard in New Orleans in 1980.  I was stationed at the Coast Guard base on the industrial canal.  It was a Sunday and I had watch.  My watch included walking to the docks and ensuring the vessels were properly tied off. I had the 0800-1200 watch.  The weather was clear with no visible cloud deck, the temperature was 70-80 degrees.  While I was walking on the dock, I stopped and talked to two other coast guardsmen who I had known from Bootcamp.  One was fishing around the docks and the other was going to relieve me in the next hour or so.  While we were standing there talking I noticed a slight line in the sky approximately 20 yards away and a 50 degree angle south.  I focused on the line and realized it was a small (4-5 foot diameter) disc rotating.  The bottom and of the disc was the same color as the sky.  The top of the disc during a slight uneven rotation was dark.  The line was the slight uneven rotation appearing like a line. I pointed to the object and offered simple orientation verbiage until both of the other men saw the object.  For the first two or three minutes we stood and stared. I asked the men to describe the object in as much details as they could.  The object was within 20 yards of our location and clearly visible.  In fact I commented that if I had a sidearm, I could easily shoot it.  There appeared to be small circular deviations in the surface below the center of the widest part of the diameter.  We discussed the lack of sound, vapors, lights or purpose for the small circles.  We discussed the possible propulsion system and observed no evidence to indicate a source. At that time I begin to use common aircraft taxiing signals to attempt to communicate with the object.  The airplane signals were not responded to however, when I started using helicopter signals the object would respond by descending in small movements to the landing signal.  At that time we observed the upper portion of the object was dark in color similar to the color of the water.  I attempted other common movements including pointing, waving and signal the object to come closer without response. According the one of the men, we had at that time engaged the object for 15-16 minutes and the only response had occurred from the helicopter signals.  I moved closer to the object until I was at the end of the dock and my position was approximately 10 yards from the object and it was at about 75 degrees.  I continued to describe the physical characteristics of the object. When the two other men moved toward the end of the dock, the object moved rapidly to the west until it disappeared.  We used dead reckoning and all measurements in angle or degrees are approximate. We report the incident to the Watch Commander and met with an officer from the Air Force.  He listened to our statements and advised us “to forget about it because by the time we were debriefed we wouldn’t know our own family.”  This is a discrete incident and I have conveyed the complete event.

We had watched several stars move across the sky as the earth rotated. We knew they were stars because of their twinkle and the direction they were moving across the sky. We also saw a plane flying south and we could hear the sound and see the lights blinking.  Then over a thin sheet of clouds we saw a small light. It seemed to be a satellite.  As it passed over another sheet of clouds is disappeared.  It was moving relatively fast compared to the stars and planes we had seen. Also it was not moving the same direction as the stars due to the rotation of the Earth.  Within a few seconds the same light appeared again and had turned a 110 degree direction. We all witnessed the light as it moved slowly then stopped.  It moved and stopped several times. It moved over another sheet of clouds and we could not see it. We were all pretty confused by what we saw.  However, we know for sure it was not a helicopter because of how high the light was.  There were no sounds or other lights with it.

I watched them for approximately 3 minutes as they moved across the sky.  A car pulled in the neighborhood, so I needed to move my car.  When I finally reached my mother's house I couldn't find them again. I have a keen interest in UFO's and sightings, and I tried to think of everything I could to explain what I saw.  The lights did not behave like traditional air craft lights.  They were much to big and they were not blinking.  Plus, I believe that aircraft would've moved faster across the sky.  They were not lights from a cell phone tower or from a satellite or star.  I'm telling you, these lights were very large.   I wasn't going to report this until I spoke with my father today.  He said that he saw something similar last night in his area of town.  Apparently, he was watching some fireworks with his wife and neighbors and they saw them as well.  He said he even said, ""Hey, do you see that?"" to his neighbor about them.  That's when I knew this was a significant event and that I needed to say something.

It seemed to loop around quickly to change directions, then accelerated at a sharp angle as if trying to land quickly.  It disappeared.  The area in which it seemed to go down was too far from Fort Campbell to be near that airfield.  It had a V shape of bright white lights that seemed to be in a straight line sometimes depending on the angle.  At first I could only see the three lights at the outside angles forming a triangle.  I only saw white lights, no color.  The lights were equally spaced apart at least 6 or 7 in number.  I did not hear any sound of a helicopter or plane.  I’m guessing the distance to be less than a football field away from my car.  There were plenty of vehicles on the interstate including truck drivers.  No one even slowed down.  My daughter and I saw it simultaneously.  It seemed obvious that it wasn’t an ordinary airplane.  I wonder if it is some fancy military craft.

Up on my left I noticed some bright lights, three or four whites & one larger red at an unusually low altitude. At first, I thought maybe it was from a tower of some kind, but it was too big and was definitely some sort of craft. It looked like plane lights kinda, but it wasn't moving at all.  It hovered at about 700 to 1100 feet. I could not see the shape because of the brightness of the object.  Then it started moving and turning/rotating, and for a moment I saw it outlined against the sky. It was a black triangle probably about 30 to 40 feet long. It hovered/turned to where the wings were facing the ground as if turning a tight turn. Then it moved out of sight VERY quickly. Probably a mile in 15 to 30 seconds!

I, my wife, and 2 teen aged daughters were present. At 10:11 pm, a glowing orange object appeared in the northeastern sky.  The object was traveling very quickly in a southeast direction, and it disappeared in the southern sky about 30 seconds later.  The object was flying at an altitude lower than airplanes in the area travel.  The object did not make any sound.  It was evident from both the altitude of the object, the distance it traveled, its size, and the fact that it made no sound that it was not fireworks. The fireworks being lit in the neighborhood were of the consumer variety, not the kind used by professional fireworks show producers. One witness, my 19 year old daughter, described the object at ""a  round orange ball.""   She also described it as looking like ""a crown.""   My wife described it as ""glowing,"" and appearing to look like ""a hot air balloon."" My 14 year old daughter described it as ""red, glowing, pentagon of fire.""

At first, we thought it might be some type of Chinese lantern, but the object did not flicker and was moving slightly against the wind.  The object finally drifted into a hazy cloud bank and dissappeared. About 2 minutes later we spotted another object going in the same direction and speed but higher up and a little south of the first object.  We watched this object until it was obscured by some trees. The third onject was about a mile north of the first object and was only in view for a few seconds before being obscured by trees. The fourth object appeared about 3 minutes later, and was almost overhead.  The object was also going in the same general direction, but a little lower.   We watched it cross the sky for almost a minute before it just seemed to fade out. We waited for another 20 minutes but saw nothing further. These objects were a bright orange color, solidly lit, and moved in a steady speed and direction.  They did not flicker, and were not affected by the wind. We were both a little freaked out, and tried to rationalize the sightings with prosaic explanations like small planes, Chinese lanterns, balloons etc.  But there was no noise, and if they were balloons or lanterns, they would have to have been released a mile or two from each other, and at different times rather than from the same place and all at once.

UFO Sighting Place: Flatwoods, KY Date and time: July 4, 2014 between 20:30 and approximately 22:30,  July 5 apprx. 21:00 – 22:00   	In Flatwoods, Kentucky I usually take an hour long walk in the evening for fitness reasons. I decided I would take a slightly shorter walk this night because I was getting started so late and didn't want to walk in the dark too much. After making my preparations, I began my walk at about 20:40. The sun was setting very low in the west. 	I was standing on the corner of Argillite Road and Bellefonte Road when I saw the first anomalous objects. The time was approximately 21:00 and the sky was still light, but darkening.  	The objects were in the sky in the distance in the direction of the Flatwoods City Building beyond Super Quick. There were two objects moving slowly towards the direction of Russell, to the east. They appeared spherical in the distance and I thought they were odd because their appearance and behavior didn't match to a plane or a helicopter. They were not shaped like a plane, appearing vaguely spherical in the distance and were moving far too slowly to be planes but faster than a balloon would normally travel. Both objects appeared to be dark gray or black in the distance. The lead object had a light on it of an amber/red color that appeared to come from the bottom of the object. The object following behind it was unlit.  	Many in the neighborhood were setting off fireworks due to the 4th of July. Many were large type exploding in the air with very loud booms and sparklers and wizzers coming out at 200 to 400 feet up.  	On arriving home, my father remarked to me that he saw two objects to the east over the Armco Steel Plant (located in Russell, KY, to the east on the Ohio River) moving east to west. 	A few minutes later as I was standing in the driveway watching fireworks, an anomalous red light flew over the house at a high speed from the north horizon towards the south. After passing directly over the area it dimmed slightly, then lit up fully again, then dimmed once more until it could no longer be seen. I called to my father who was watching fireworks on the back porch and he come out with binoculars. About five minutes later, an object of similar configuration did the same, and a few minutes after that another one came. This happened numerous times.  	This time, I was able to get a better look at the object through the set of binoculars and could see that there was a dark solid mass of some kind attached to the light. The light appeared to be moving under this dark object which appeared vaguely round or spherical from my point of view. It was at this point that I made the mental connection back to the anomalous objects I saw during my walk. I realized that I had had a daylight sighting of two of these strange spheroid objects, one of which was shining an orange/red light from its lower part and the other of which was not. When I moved the binoculars down, I could still see the dark outline of this object as it flew quickly over the house, so it must have been very close. I would estimate it to have been 30-40 ft. across if it were at an elevation of 1500 – 2000 ft. If it were at this size and elevation it must have been moving completely silently at a speed of about 200-300 kts. All of the objects in this series moved in! a straight line at this speed from horizon to horizon. They made no heading changes but they appeared to dip in altitude as they approached the area and then climb and fade as they came over or passed it.  	 	After this first series of objects had flown directly over the area, another object came in a similar direction from the north, but was flying over an area slightly to the east  us rather than directly over us as the previous objects had done. This object exhibited the most atypical and dramatic behavior of all the objects sighted. It appeared to descend and dim its orange/red light, appearing to fade as the others had, but I could still discern the fuzzy outline of a dark spheroid object in the darkness. Instead of totally fading and climbing back up, it slowed down and suddenly lit up in a brilliant fluorescent blue-green green color before descending rapidly and going out of view to the southeast within what seemed to be only a mile or so. We did not see this object again after it did this.  	After this happened, a few more of these strange objects appeared over the house in the same course as the previous series, but eventually the activity tapered off after about 22:30 and the objects were not seen again that night. My father and I remained watching for them for a period of about an hour and a half more but saw no more of these anomalous objects.  No sound or noise of any kind could be heard from any of the unidentified objects.   	During the course of this UFO encounter, we observed three brightly lit objects which appeared to be satellites. Their direction of travel was approximately, one east to west, one north to south, and  one south to north. Planes were observed flying overhead during this incident with red, green, white and strobe lights.  	In the course of the incident we managed to capture photographic evidence of the objects, but they are low quality due to the fact that we were taking pictures of distant objects at night with cameras that were not meant for nighttime use.  	The next night, July 5th, my father, mother, and grandmother were all out watching fireworks from neighborhood again (the same type as the night of the 4th).  In about a similar time frame as the incident of the previous night, more objects of the same kind seen on the night of the 4th were sighted by me, my father, and mother. I also managed to capture a photograph of one of the objects that appeared this night.  	The direction or travel was from the northeast horizon towards southwest 	I kept watch outside the house the next night, the 6th, in case more objects would show themselves, but aside from a dim red light in the distance to the west which faded rapidly, I had no sighting comparable to the previous night's.",I was outside smoking a cigarette (I know it's bad for me) and I am a college student who recently took an Astronomy course so I love t,FLATWOODS,KY,SPHERE,2014,0.951597349,0.629104821,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,0.241875559,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,-0.826953785,0,NA,NNW,CLEAR

6,25,15,five minutes,"Flying disk-shaped object seen traveling in a straight line I'm sorry but my computer would not let me do the copy and paste.  I live a short distance from where this incident took place.  This is my report, and I am an expert U.S. Government typist.   On Friday,  June 25, 2010, at around 3:00 PM, I was in town doing some shopping at our local Kroger store on the Scottsville Road.  The day was clear, hot, and humid.  When I came out of the Kroger store I saw a man in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so I decided to have a look for myself.  We both saw to our amazement what looked like a flying disk or saucer-type object traveling straight across the sky.   At first I dismissed it as a balloon, but the longer I watched it I began to wonder exactly what it was that we were seeing.  The object was large, and looked to be twice the size of an automobile.  There were no other around either.  It was about a mile away as close as I could tell.  The object was disk-shaped and was a very shiny silver color.  There looked t! o be indentations or lights around the edges of the object as well.  The main reasons I began to truly wonder if it was a balloon was these.  The object traveled in a very straight path line where as a balloon would wobble up and down and not fly in a straight formation.  As the silver object flew it tilted from one side to the other about a mile apart each time as if showing off.  First it tilted and flew sideways with its top showing, and then it would tilt again and fly sideways with the bottom showing.  The object repeatedly  did this over and over again the whole fives minutes I watched it.  If it was a craft it may have been going out of control.  There were no streamers of markings on, or attached, to the object like a balloon would have either.  It continued flying along at the same altitude.  I put my groceries inside my car, and then looked back up and the object was gone.  I think it may have went behind some cloud cover or fell somewhere.  This may be a coincide! nce, but shortly after as I was traveling home on the Scottsvi! lle Road their was a traffic jam or something holding up the traffic.  Finally we came upon a large semi truck that was stopped dead in the road.  To make it seem weird there was nothing visible wrong with the truck, and I could not a see any truck drivers either.  No other vehicles were damaged either.  There were close to seven police cars that just simply had this truck surrounded, and the roadway cordoned off.  Amazingly, the truck was in a direct path as to where the mysterius disk-shaped object would have traveled over.  Did he see it and stop?  Did something crash?  I don't know.  Did anyone else see this object besides us?  Did the object stop the engine of the truck?  I wonder now.   Anyway, that's my report.   I am a Christian, and this sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability.   If anyone else saw this object I would love to know about it.","I was in front of chickie's and Pete's... 681, shannondell blvd Audubon PA 19403, home wood suites.",BOWLING GREEN,KY,DISK,2010,-0.163149246,1.722273091,0,0.730338896,NA,0,0.0642725,1.250373114,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,-0.779388567,0,NA,NNW,MOSTLY CLOUDY

In the middle of our conversation I looked up into the sky Due South East towards the city of Topeka as I'm an avid skywatcher. The night sky was clear showcasing all the stars, milky way, and constellations. I seen an object that looked just like a star in the night sky with the exception that it was brighter than the rest of the stars out. The shape would have been round I guess since it looked exactly like a star in the night sky. The color it was emitting was a mix between white and yellow. I jokingly told my friend ""Is that a UFO?"". He said he didn't know what it is, maybe a space station was the only answer he could come up with. Being an avid skywatcher I quickly went through my options. Falling stars and space debris follow a trajectory and I quickly checked that off the list. The object was moving fairly fast towards the southeast. Kansas has wide open sky's and airplanes you! can usually hear and see the blinking lights on them or the red and blues on the wing.  This had neither.  Plus with the object heading southeast of my position and away from us, you wouldn't be able to see the front headlights on an airplane. About a minute into the sighting the light emitting from the object dimmed  to a more circular ball of light that would be consistent with the stars at night.  A few seconds later the object just disappeared completely, just poof and it was gone. The sighting lasted anywhere from 1 1/2 minutes to 2.

In approx. mid Oct 2000, my boyfriend & I were outside in a friends hot tub by ourselves (everyone else was inside by now) & around 11 pm-12 am saw a strange, slow- moving triangular/stealth/kite-shaped ""plane"" moving slowly & silently across the sky.  It came from the west (we were in the west side of town) & as it moved overhead we could see it was silvery & seemed to be reflecting what looked like flames (we could only see the bottom side).  It was really weird, it didn't seem to have any lights on it- or at least any we could see.  But the Whole bottom part we could see was silvery & reflecting flames- so it was very bright!! The flames were moving, like real flames, so there were at times places on this aircraft (?!) that didn't have any flames & it was hard to tell whether it was silvery or kind of almost ""invisible"" sort of blending in to the sky.   Eventually it moved over us & we couldn't see it anymore.  We were asking each other: did ! we just really see that?!  But we kinda figured it was maybe a test of some kind of craft that's being tested for blending in better & Not any kind of alien tech.  Maybe we weren't supposed to see it?! Maybe they (gov?! Military?!) would've liked to know if it was seen?! Didn't know what to think of this or what to do?!

As I looked straight up, I noticed what appeared to me to be a flight of military fighter jets flying in a triangular formation very high up.  As I noticed this, I told my girlfriend who had spotted the same thing.   Upon further observation, I thought the objects looked more like stars, as they were small and appeared to be white lights.  My girlfriend maintains that it was a single, solid object with lights on the leading edges.  Regardless of their shape they continued to fly straight at a constant speed in a westerly direction.  Soon the formation (or possibly one single craft) broke apart.  The objects on either side took off at extraordinary speed to the north and south respectively until they were completely invisible.  Soon the leading object did the same, flying straight ahead to the west.  These objects were moving extremely fast, and apparently at an extremely high altitude.  They literally took less than a second to disappear completely from sight.  Pleas note that the date and time of this sighting is NOT exact.

I don't think it was sunlight reflecting off a fuselage as the sun had been down for too long. It wasn't a satellite (I note those often) this was much much brighter. I am an avid skywatcher and this is the first time I've seen something I couldn't identify. Tonight, (7/16/06) my wife and I observed an object that could have been the same one. I'll file that sighting next. I give you my word as a Texan that this is the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6,27,12,15 minutes,"30 red balls seen twice My 2 step brothers and I where fishing at the old Boonedocks lake behind the Crystal Flash off of I65 area.  We parked at the new Anson townhomes subdivision and walked in the backway to the lake.  Me and one of my step brothes walked to the car at about midnight to grab some stuff, he said WOW! Look at that. I seen up to 30 red or orange lights spreading apart.  I couldn't believe my eyes I had to walk closer they were I would guess no more than 500 feet up. I rubbed my eyes I though they where red lights like on the top of electrical poles, BUT they where moving.  After they spread apart One buy one they either dissipated or headed REAL fast east towards carmel.  I then proceeded to call the Boone County Sheriff. I said "" I really don't know if I wanna gice my name or even report this incident but I just seen something wierd"" SHE PROCEEDED TO SAY ""  Was it the red lights' needless to say I was pretty freaked out.  I said yes, and gave her my description, and told ! her i was freaked , she said an officer at the crystal flash seen them and pretty much gave her the exact report.  We went back to fishing needless to say our other stepbrother really didn't believe us.  My other witness said that when he seen it first it was like a line, or possibly a triangle, and when it spread apart he said it made a geometric pattern or design that he could connect with lines.   Then I got a call at 12:15 from the police.  She told me she called the airport and the military, nothing is going on but there was one plane somewhere in the area.  And the officer that seen it wanted to file a report with the military and the initernational airport police,  And wanted to use my name. I gave themm permission.  We didnt get a bite all night kinda wierd.  We left at 2:45 when we got back to our vehicle to our surprise there was 2 red lights in the sky! NOW WE ALL have seen them .  PLUS others where emitting from the ground which could not have been more than 5 miles away.  They had white almost emulsions then would turn into the balls! of ligh ts.  Each one would come up , then towards us ,then sit for a minute, then fade away straight north.  I called the police during this action which went on for up to 15 minutes they would not even harldy talk to me I asked if anyone else is reporting this they went blank, and flat told me ""there is nothing we can do"" we had to have seen all 30 of them coming up but only around 10 of them would be there at once before another would be moving north and fading away.  I think they were right over zionsvile and within a quarter mile of us. It felt REAL CLOSE.  I tried to take a pic with my cell phone but it didnt show up. After wards we talked for a while thinkn no one will believe us.  BUT if anyone else seen what I seen PLEASE let it be known.  Especially that cop.

7,24,22,35 min.,"My Husband (driving),  our nine year old daughter,  two small sons and I were driving South on St. Rd. 15 on a return trip from Goshen Indiana at around10:20 P.M.  We were about 2 miles from Warsaw, Indiana when I noticed 2 objects off to the Southwest  that  were spaced much farther apart than the lights on an airplane wing.  These lights were round and were moving Southwest on a very clear night.  My Husband dismissed them as air planes due to the proximity of the local airport.  I talked him into turning down a side road to the West in the direction of the 2 orange lights.   Approximately 3/4 of a mile down this road we saw another object lower to the tree line to our Southwest. This object, the same as the first two appeared as a round, orange  complete circle moving / hovering South.  We turned South and then back to the West and found a clearing with a wide view of the horizon.  It was around 11P.M.  With the car off we sat in the entrance of a field facing to the South.  Within 5 minutes we were witnesses to an amazing display of these objects.  First a cluster of 2 appeared,  stationary to the South and then disappeared, one appeared just to the East, two reappeared again and then three more to the West of the other three for a total of six round orange objects in the Southwestern sky.  It seemed as though the objects were communicating to one another.  All the objects were stationary at this time of our observation. At this point a small panic ensued in our car and we left the area amazed, excited and feeling our world as a much smaller place.","I saw a Spherical, metallic object hovering one or two thousand feet up in Reno, NV.",WARSAW,IN,CIRCLE,2008,0.151602734,0.629104821,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,0.342725314,0,0,NA,-0.357641004,0,-0.636692912,0,NA,SW,CLEAR
5,25,22,3 minutes,"I saw an object tracking SSE to NNW at spacecraft altitude and witnessed a thrust burst. On  5/25/14 at 10:55 pm I stepped outside for a few as it was much cooler outside.  I regularly watch aircraft from the back yard and track the ISS at its higher flight paths. When I first seen the object, just a small light as bright as an average star,  It was 70-80 degrees above the western horizon and 30 degrees south of due west, tracking SSE to NNW.  I thought it might be the ISS because it was much to high (small) and fast to be a plane.   As it moved across the sky it seemed to disappear for a few seconds and then reappear as though there were clouds,  There were no clouds! This happened three times from when I first saw it and when it reached a point about 40 degrees north of due west. It was then that the brightness increased exponentially,  Bright white increasing the apparent size by at least ten times, this lasted about one second and it was out of my sight.  The object never varied from it's track. I then went to check ISS tracking information and found it couldn't have been that.

I witnessed something last night i am unable to comprehend. 	On the night of June 22, 2013 at approximatly 10:30 pm i noticed a group of 5 to 7 red round shaped objects in a staggered v shape followed by 2 more of the same isolated objects.   I apologize for not counting exactly how many there were but i assure you it was 5 or 7 in the first group.  I was somewhat taken back by what i was witnessing.  They appeared at the south horizon just above a tree line.  They traveled at what seemed to be a slow rate of speed northeast toward an almost full moon.   They then began to dissapear individually about fifteen seconds after they appeared to me.   These objects did not move in an abrupt fashion or shift in any way but in a linear motion. 	This account took place as i was sitting om my girlfriends front porch patio.   I'm an avid star gazer so naturally i was staring at the sky while my girlfriend went inside to grab her sons overnight bag for him. His grandfather was sitting in his truck in the driveway facing north bound. I  noticed the objects and stood up to get a better look at the event and in awe just pointed at the sky, speechless! As the group shaped in the v pattern began to dissapear Missy, my girlfriend walked out of the front door onto the patio. She noticed me pointing at the sky and cuaght sight of the two objects that followed. They then began to fade into the night sky. At first i thought that they had dissapeared behind cloud cover but after further investigation i realized the sky was very clear with no visible clouds. 	Im not sure what i witnessed but i can tell you that ive never seen anything like it before in my life. After discussing the event with Missy i decided to notify someone of the event. I tried to figure out a logical explanation for what i had seen but was unable to. I  wanted so badly to find out if others had seen the same thing so when i woke up the following morning after a restless night of sleeping i immeditely looked in the paper and browsed the internet for other sightings. I then chose to call the National UFO sighting hotline. I truley hope that others will come forward and tell there stories of the same event if they witnessed this unexplained event.

I was videotaping at the time it was sighted the second time and managed to get some video of it.

When I turned I looked up at the moon and noticed a pulsating orange orb/fireball but it wasn't fire that I was seeing.  If you were facing south the moon was probably 70degrees in the sky from the horizon.  If you were looking at the moon and imagined it was a clock it would have been at about 4:30.   Now keep in mind this was a full moon, and it was bright enough to really stand out considering it was close to the moon.  It was stationary I live exactly 3 blocks from the road that I had turned off of.  I was driving fast because I wanted my mom to see it, it took me prob 30 seconds to get to my house.   I told my mom to come see it the object started moving in a southwest direction.   Now by the time we went outside in back yard it had accelerated extremely fast in a matter of about 25 seconds it was onl! y about 15 to 20 degrees above the southwest horizon!  It had to have accelerated to a very high speed and was out of eye sight within 15seconds of coming outside to the backyard!  I am not sure of the altitude but it seemed like at least 15 or 20 thousand feet because a plane came into view that was not to far away from the object, and then it was out of sight!  It made no sound, but since I didn't know its height it may have just been to high to hear it.  I couldn't make an educated guess on its size.  It looked like a ball of orange pulsating energy, I believe that it was not a part of a nuts and bolts craft I cant say for 100% certainty but that's what it seemed to be!

10,23,8,45 minutes,"Oval foggy Orbs  2-4, going around in a circle above houses, following me down the street, in Fishers, IN Last night, Oct. 23, 2012, my son and I walked out of the house to walk our dogs.  My son took one of the dog’s around the block and I took the older dog the other direction down the street.  We always meet up at the end of the street. So as I was walking down the driveway I noticed above my neighbors’ house across the street 4 roundish lights going around in a large circle.  The circle was about the size of the house.  They were not real bright, almost resembled a foggy, cloudy light, but they were very noticeable.  At first I thought someone had some strobe light, which I dismissed, because it was not how a strobe light would look. I will explain that in a minute.  So I’m standing out in front of my house and a neighbor walks by with her dog.  I asked her if she saw the same thing I was seeing and she said “yes.”  I then asked her what she thought the lights were from and she thought perhaps one of those big lights from a store.  Then as we both looked at the lights weaving in and out as though they were chasing each other, we decided that couldn’t be, since that would be obvious if it were one of those big lights.  Let me make this clear.  I’m 51, I’ve seen the store lights in the sky, I’ve seen strobe ! lights too.  These circling lights were something I have never seen. They would go higher in the sky and then get lower.  At one point they were high enough to cross the path of a small plane going by.  It’s hard to estimate the distance of objects in the sky, so they may have been some distance from the airplane. Here’s the weirdest part.  As I continued to walk my dog the lights followed me.  When I reached the last house, there were only 2 orb type circles.  Still they were going around like they were chasing each other.  My son, was walking from the field, and the first thing he said was “Aliens.”  And I’m like, “ are you seeing them too?”  He tells me that he would not have noticed, but our dog stopped and looked at the lights, which made him freak, because she always runs the whole walk. My son, took off towards our house, leaving me with the lights and my slow dog.  I crossed the street and headed back home, aan of course the lights followed me.  I stopped several times just to study them.  When I reached my house, they were right above.  I took my dog into the house and grabbed my phone to videotape them.  As I taped them they were now high above in the middle of the street, and kept getting higher.  I’m not sure if I was able to capture them on my camera, but I haven’t checked. They finally disappeared   I have decided, without a doubt, they were either Spirits in the form of Orbs, or UFO’s of some sort.   I’m always going to believe something is manmade way before I conclude it is from a different source. But with this sighting, I see no other option, but to believe what I witnessed was from a supernatural origin, and they were studying me.  I also feel something big is about to take place.","I saw a very large balloon through my telescope, was it Google's?",FISHERS,IN,LIGHT,2012,-0.032002587,0.179577682,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,0.393150192,1,0,-0.055151095,1.649151817,0,0.267046232,0,-0.289487343,SW,LIGHT THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN

Although I do know for certain that it occurred in the summer of 2009. The following is absolute fact, and has convinced me that we are not alone in the universe. 	While driving westbound on Illinois Route 148 from Mt. Vernon, Illinois; about two miles before reaching Waltonville, an inner voice spoke to me. “Look up if you want to see us,” crossed my mind. An unseen female voice was speaking within my male body, and seemed to not be coming from my own mind. I immediately leaned over the steering wheel, looking upward through the windshield. Seeing nothing unusual I thought to myself,”I don’t see anything.” Immediately a response came from that internal female voice,”Keep looking.” I again focused harder on the same area of sky and I could barely make out a large grouping of silver, circular shaped objects flying at high altitude. 	Upon seeing the objects I pulled the vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway, in order to more safely view the objects. I would estimate the objects’ altitude at approximately 40,000 feet. The altitude was of the height that if it were any greater, the objects would have been undetectable by the naked eye. They seemed to be flying in a group; some coming together into small groupings and flying around each other. I watched for a minute or so and they drifted out of view. What I saw could not have been balloons, because balloons don’t speak to people telepathically.

My boyfriend, two friends visiting from out of town, and I were enjoying an evening outside on our backyard.  It was right about 11:30 pm when we saw a very large, unusually bright, orange looking fireball that seemed to suddenly rise above the two story house which sits behind us.  The weather was clear that night; it truly was a beautiful evening out. It was so large and bright that it looked like it was right above us but really it was so far away. It was easily 20, 000 plus feet high in the air. The reason I am sure of this, is our guests that evening are of military and have government backgrounds, and are quit knowledgeable in these areas.  They too sat in wonder and curiosity as we watched this thing traveling above and across us.  The fireball first appeared above our neighbor’s  house to the East of us traveling West, moving toward us,  at a somewhat constant speed not to fast; as it became to become directly passing above us; one of the guys pointed out it appeared to have what looked like a ring around it.. They certainly couldn’t offer any explanations of what we were seeing, none of us could. Something else we noticed, there was absolutely was no sound coming from this object! It is not a far distance from the house behind us to ours, but it was just a few minutes, as it passed across us and once it did the orange fireball began to cross over the top of our house it continued moving West but at the same time seemed to almost move straight upward as well, much, much higher moving what look to disappear into the stars.

It was getting close to closing time when I went out back to take out the garbage.   On my way back into the store I saw 3 strange red lights flying north above LaGrange road.   At first, I thought it was one giant craft in the shape of a triangle.  But I waited for the formation to pass under some stars, and when the stars didn’t black out like I had expected, I realized that it was 3 craft flying synchronized in a triangle formation.  I knew what I was seeing because I’d seen the videos before and watched some UFO documentaries.  I may not necessarily believe in aliens, but I knew what I was seeing was unexplained.  I immediately ran inside to grab any witness I could.  I was shouting, “Hurry, It’s a UFO come on!  It’s those ones you see on TV!”  Only my co-worker ((male name deleted)) came out to see. He recognized the formation too and tried to record it on his iPhone, but it was dark and! nothing showed up on the video.   Another co-worker of ours came out too, but by then 2 of the 3 red lights had faded away, so it didn’t seem like anything extraordinary to him.   I resumed closing up the store.  I was quite shaken up and even told some customers about what I had seen.   About 15 minutes later, I was outside again taking more garbage out, when I saw 2 more red.  These 2 lights weren’t flying in any formation and they were flying much faster than the first 3 I had seen.  They were traveling the same route:  North up LaGrange road curving East over I-80.  It seemed as though the 2 were trying to catch up to the other 3 lights.   Before I went home, I stopped at the BP gas station located at LaGrange and 191st st.  There were to Mokena police officers in there, and I was so shocked by what I had seen, I even had the nerve to ask the police officers if they had heard about any UFO sightings, at the risk of sounding crazy. They didn’t hear anything and I did get the feeling they thought I was crazy.   I later found out that there happened to be multiple famous UFO sightings really close by in Tinley Park.

I finally decided in the summer of 2001 that UFO's were real, and I have come to grips with growing up on a farm in the cornlands of Illinois. You do a good job, and I thought at the time it was a few hours latter the Bolingbrook fellow had seen what I saw, either that morning or a few hours after I saw it. Where it was you could only see the top as it was only about 50 feet over a busy intersection in broad daylight but in the trees of the park just off the road. Thats all I can say about that one, however I have a friend who had an experience in my home in late 1996 early 1997, and that is another story. Keep up the good work.

4,1,5,3-4 Minutes,"On 4/1/08 at 05:30 I saw three objects with very intense bright white strobes over  Homer Glen Illinois. I was getting on Toll way I-355 north, from west bound Route 6 in New Lenox. I noticed the strobes while on the ramp and watched them for the next several miles (minutes) as I headed north on I-355. The objects were northwest from the Toll way and about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The weather was dry but overcast, I have no idea what the ceiling was at the time. The three objects appeared to be identical in the fact that all three had the same varying intensity, and frequency of the strobe effect, but the objects were not in sync with each other. Since they were identical in brightness and appearance I assume they were of the same size and distance from me. There was also many strobes on each object with some slightly more intense than others, making each object look like a continuous varying strobe. There were no other lights, no red or green or landing lights, no steady lights of any kind, just very white intense strobes. I could not see any discernable shape of an object or objects, or tell how many strobes there were per object since the strobes on each object were very close to each other. My best description is each object was like a cluster of tightly packed, very intense strobe lights. The objects also appeared to interact with each other, meaning as one moved another would follow. This dance went on for a minute or two. Then while two of them were more or less stationary the third one headed away then quickly, amazingly quick, turned around and passed right between the other two and came to an abrupt stop shortly after passing them, making all three the same distance apart. Shortly after that maneuver the three objects got in a straight line with one another (north to south), were equidistant to each other, and appeared to be heading south (remember I’m heading north at 65+ MPH)  and then climbed away slowly at a 45 degree angle. At this point they were now due west of me. I never did see them enter the cloud deck or if they changed direction due to my vantage point while driving, and a strong desire to stay on the road. As they were climbing away the distance between them slowly increased but they were always equidistant to each other, as if in formation, and their appearance and strobe intensity although fading, remained constant between them. I am an aircraft technician and I am very familiar with various, not all, aircraft and helicopter lighting. I see airplanes almost everyday and night, going into and out of Chicago’s Midway and  O’Hare airports, and several smaller airports, as I travel over 100 miles roundtrip every day (or night) to and from work. I am very familiar with the traffic and holding patterns too. In fact I did see airplane traffic in their usual routes, north and east of my location (for the given wind direction at that time). These objects were not in that vicinity, they were alone. I am also aware that there was a Hotel fire in Lockport Illinois, to the south and west from were I witnessed these objects, and the local news teams did have their helicopters up covering it, but these objects were nowhere near that location. I have never seen helicopters with so many intense strobes. I have never seen helicopters or any other aircraft accelerate and decelerate in such a short distance(?) and time. And, I have never seen them “play” with each other for a lack of a better description, and depart in single file and climb at a 45 degree angle. I am not saying it couldn’t have been 3 identical aircraft or 3 identical helicopters playing cat and mouse in the predawn hours, all I’m saying is I have never witnessed anything like it in my 30 plus years in aviation.","I am a night sky watcher and I have seen a lot of military maneuvers and a few strange things in this area, but what I saw this evening",HOMER GLEN,IL,LIGHT,2008,-1.317239838,-1.10770458,0,NA,-0.023749543,0,NA,-0.564922485,0,0,NA,3.853658216,0,0.980524504,0,1.816736073,WEST,UNKNOWN

I was standing in the back yard of my house testing-out a new green laser pointer, pointing it at the stars to observe the beam in the air.

It seemed to be moving quite quickly towards the spot in the sky where I had pulsed the laser a few seconds earlier.  Thinking that it was a plane, I was worried that I might have distracted the pilot, as I am always careful to avoid pointing my laser at aircraft.

It was much brighter than any star in the sky.  It was slightly yellow, about the same color as the sun at midday.  It made no sound.  Its motion reminded me of that of a satellite, with no obvious changes in direction or speed relative to the stars.

At first I thought it was the moon but something looked off.  The circle was slightly oval, seemed lower and was brighter than the moon.  Plus half of it was dark.  It looked like it was divided in half.  Half dark and half golden - yellow. I went inside my house and a few minutes later looked outside and noticed the “moon” was higher and farther away.  I ran to get my mother.  When I came back outside the object was orange and moving very fast across the sky.  By the time my mother arrived outside the object was just an orange flash behind the trees.  The object then disappeared from sight.  The object was silent. I submitted another report to NUFROC a few minutes ago about seeing a HUGE reddish – orange fireball in the same area.  I accidentally entered 1 & 2 witnesses because I was going to submit these reports together but changed my mind. I declined to be contacted for these fireball sightings because there is nothing else I can add.

It was perfectly circular with what appeared to be an indentation in the center and a horizontal darker patch running across the circle.   I grabbed my hunting rifle to see it at a higher magnification and could see a much more detailed view.

5,15,18,35 Seconds,"I was sitting in the passenger's side of the car, and i saw a dark triangular shape in the sky, and then drift in the clouds. I used to go to school at the alternative school in Moscow, though i live in another town. At the time the school got out at around 5-6:00 pm. I don't know the name of the road we were on, but it was down the road only a little ways from the alternitive school, and we were going to head west. We were sitting in traffic for a long time. It was sort of a windy cloudy day which is rather typical in Moscow. My friend was driving the car and i was in the passengers seat.  We sat there for quite some time and i began looking up into the white sky and suddenly i saw something that was pretty strange. I didn't say anything for a moment and i did not take my eyes off of what is saw that day.  In the sky was a dark colored triangular aircraft of some kind. It was perfectly triangular and was obviously not something natural. I wouldn't say it was black; more of a metallic dark grey. I was comepletely amazed at what i saw, and for the most part i wanted to be practical and believe it had an obvious explaination. It seemed to have been standing in place but suddenly it started moving. It was moving steadily fast. I moved fast enough that it was leaving sight rather quickly, but it wasn't leaving at lightning speed. It was a super cloudy day that day, and it was probably strange that we even saw it at all considering how overcast it was. I watched it go into the clouds and i kept looking out for it, but i simply didn't see it at all.  My friend then spoke up and told me that she had just seen something really weird. She hadn't known that i had seen it too. And my i told her that i had seen it and we talked about it for the ride home. I kept looking for it all the way home, but i didn't see anything strange. I decided to believe it was nothing, and when i told adults, they sort of looked at me as though i didn't know what i was talking about, since i was only sixteen at the time. I gave up trying to get anyone to believe me and soon i quit thinking about it, though i never forgot it.  A couple nights ago something sparked my memory and so i decided to look it up on the internet and i did some research. I didn't even know that triangular shaped UFO's are reported but i found out that they are. And i looked at the description and sure enough, the descriptions had an uncanny resemblance to what i saw. So, i looked into it further. I typed in something about triangular ufo's seen in Moscow Idaho. I didn't think i would get anything. I found a reporting on this website that took place on the same date someone else had reported a sighting. I also noticed that that it is not particularily common for Moscow to have reported UFO sightings on this website. But mainly, i was take away that it was on the same day. So my friend and i were not the only ones to see it, and not only that, but they saw a triangle as well.

8,6,20,56 minutes,"Bright orb viewed in twilight and night sky over Meridian/Nampa, Idaho for nearly an hour. On August 6th, 2016, I was in attendance at the stock car races at Meridian Speedway in Meridian, Idaho.  The lady seated next to me and I had been talking about my line of work as a pilot, and she began to put a couple of eye drops in her eye.  As she looked up, she said, “Oh, and there’s an airplane now.”  I, too, looked up and immediately noticed what she was looking at was most definitely not an aircraft of any kind. At first glance, the object appeared to be directly overhead the speedway at an altitude of approximately ten to fifteen thousand feet AGL (above ground level).  The object was quite bright in the evening sky.  The object was VERY slowly moving west.  The object’s shape was hard to decipher, but it was definitely not perfectly circular.  The shape was more oblong than anything, or perhaps even cylindrical shaped.  I noticed other people in attendance at the speedway were beginning to watch the object as more people had their heads turned.  I kept a keen eye on the object and noticed that it’s almost imperceptible movement began to slow after a few minutes.   The object moved from directly overhead Meridian, Idaho, to directly over what appeared to be Nampa, Idaho, in the span of fifteen minutes.  During the first few minutes of observation, my guess was that the object was a weather balloon.  Weather balloons are launched over the Treasure Valley twice daily from the National Weather Service station in Boise, Idaho.  I looked at my watch and discovered that the last weather balloon was launched over two hours ago.  The object never decreased in size during the entire hour that I watched it, indicating to me that this was definitely not a weather balloon.  Weather balloons decrease in relative size from the naked eye as they gain altitude.  This object was not gaining altitude and was remaining the same size during the entire viewing.  The object appeared to be emitting its own light, and as the sun set and the other stars and planets became visible the object appeared to become much more red in color. The lady seated next to me was quite interested in the object and tried taking numerous photos of the object with her iphone, but none of the images showed anything of merit.  After about 45 minutes of watching the object the lady seated next to me decided to go to her car and view the object with a pair of binoculars she had in her car.  She left and I last viewed the object almost an hour after first witnessing the object.  I looked up again a couple minutes later and the object was gone.  The lady returned a few minutes later looking rather flustered and stated that she was at her car viewing the object with her binoculars, looking directly at the red orb, when in vanished into thin air. I know this was not an aircraft, as I’m a full-time pilot, and I’m quite aware of what aircraft of all types look like in the sky.  This object was not a weather balloon, drone, or blimp of any kind.  The object emitted a very bright light in the evening sky and emitted a very bright red/orange glow after sunset.  The peculiar shape of the object and the odd movement of the object are what baffle me. I know dozens of other people at the speedway that night witnessed the object, so hopefully they too will write reports. I first witnessed the object at 20:17 and last saw the object at 21:13 local time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had been watching what one would assume were military aircraft flying back and forth over the western sky of SE Iowa.  There were at least a dozen of them.  They were very large with one main running light pattern.  They had very bright lights like on the wing tips and either red or white blinking lights.  But there were varied flash rates.  Some of the jets had a shape of a F15, all of them had glowing white rear parts of the engines.  They did not increase in brightness during acceleration and could be seen from any angle from my position. Now several of them were flying a rectangular pattern in the west horizon, as I was watching with my binoculars I noticed they were flying very fast.  But they would make very abrupt 90 deg turns, way to abrupt for their speed.  Then several were flying east to west and west to east directly over head.  One was flying a  north to south and back in a rectangle pattern.  When he changed his course to the west of the rectangle as it turned there was a distinct triangle pattern to its white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  This went on for a half an hour.  It was some really strange maneuvers like I have never seen before. The two jets came out of the south escorting a shinny object that looked like a large satellite moving the same speed of the jets and through the rectangle pattern the one jet had been flying.  They went across the horizon and my view would be about 30 to 40 deg of the horizon.  After the objects went out of view, all the jets split up.  Some them were playing and chasing each other.

I was sitting in the row directly behind the first-class passenger seats on the right side of the plane in the window seat.  Since I was on a smaller flight, this put my seat to where I was able to see clearly outside the window and still be able to see the front of the wing. 	During the majority of the time of the flight, I put my ear buds in and napped, as I usually do.  About 20 minutes before landing, a bell went off waking me up.  The bell was followed by an announcement, which caused me to remove my ear buds.  The announcement said to please close the windows as the craft prepared to descend.  Once this was said, the lights inside had dimmed. 	I have been on many flights before and really thought nothing of this. I figured maybe the announcement to do so, was a courtesy to others who might still be resting, or due to the summer heat in order to keep the plane cool when it had landed.  Regardless of what was said I kept window open, and watched the sights of the plane as it prepared to land. 	About twenty seconds of looking at the flooding of the many creeks and rivers of the area, I witnessed five shiny silver “tear drop/saucer” shaped objects in a formation of four on the bottom and one on top.  Each one was the same size, looking about the size of a mini van, but I could not tell how far away they were.  They looked as if they were floating, but due to how fast the plane was going, they had to be moving at some sort of slightly slower speed than the plane. 	I was definitely stunned and confused at what I had just seen, and looked at the businessman next to me, who just shrugged his shoulders.","Glowing orange objects, which you could see were round disk/sphere in shape when glow dimmed completely.",DES MOINES,IA,DISK,2015,0.466354714,1.609891306,0,-0.197022257,NA,0,0.0642725,0.80663419,0,0,NA,1.283381697,0,-1.255040748,0,NA,WEST,PARTLY CLOUDY

4,23,21,,"Red Sphere in Night Sky, Flashes Consecutive Red/Green Lights at Witness The following is what happened to me on 4/23/14 at 9:16 pm in front of my home on the island of Oahu-Honolulu, Hawaii:  On my way home alone from a nearby store, as I walked through my parking, I looked up in the night sky spotting a completley red sphere moving silently towards the northwest, at a fast rate of speed (its movement reminded me of a high traveling satellite). As soon as I noticed the red orb (bigger than a helicopter, equivalent size to a small turbo-prop plane), I immediately realized it wasn’t a satellite, aircraft, or helicopter (it made no sound).  This orb seemed to notice me back (this was my initial gut-feeling), stopping dead in the sky at that moment.  Then it started quickly flashing a green light, then a red light, and then a green light at me, consecutively, around 6-8 times and then stopped, while remaining stationary in the sky above.  The colors reminded me of that popular electronic game in the 70’s, called Simon (best example of what the red/green lights looked like) with musical tones corresponding to it’s 4 large colored buttons when pushed; or the red and green colors of a traffic light.  However, there was absolutely no sound related to my sighting of this hovering red orb, it was completely silent. It felt as if a message was being communicated to me directly, although I didn’t understand it. I mentally thought back to the object, “I don’t understand the message, what does it mean?”  As the orb still remained motionless in the sky above me, nothing more flashed towards me, nor did I get any other communication (gut-feelings/thoughts) from this object.  Next, I told the object mentally, “I believe you’re friendly, at least I think you are, but I’m not sure what it is you want.  I will tell you anything you want to know, you can ask me, but I don’t want to be abducted & examined,” (laughing to myself now, knowing this sounds absurd as I stood in the dark staring at this sphere for around 5 minutes), although I was serious at the time this happened, and this was the dialogue running through my mind. Shortly thereafter my neighbor came down the path, I instinctively knew I wasn’t going to share this with him (I don’t think he would’ve believed me anyhow), so I mentally said goodbye to the red orb, still remaining stationary in the sky above me at that time. Before I walked up my stairs, I greeted my neighbor who was unaware of the object.  As I walked up the stairs, I wondered if the red orb was still there. I called a close friend as soon as I walked in my place.  This friend said she believed my story, however I’ll never know for sure.  About a half hour later I did go back outside to see if the red orb was still there…it wasn’t.

It was certainly not a balloon or Chinese lantern. Parenthetically I saw a large triangular craft in the nearby Iao valley about two years ago, at about 3:00.

6,16,17,>20 minutes,"White-ish/blue lighted sphere that changed to a white triangle over west Maui From the beach at Ka'anapali-Lahaina, Maui Hawaii looking west, my wife and I saw a very bright light above the island of Lana'i.  At first I thought it was a planet that was much brighter than usual, such as Mars but it wasn't red, it was a very bright blue-ish-white, similar to Xenon headlights color.  At one point I had looked over to my wife to tell her to look at th bright light and she had asked about what it was.  When I looked back to see it, it had moved south and was slightly dimmer. At this point, I no longer thought it was a planet and started to think it was a plane or helicopter and shortly after we could see the shape go from a round shape that had a tint of blue, to a triangle shape that was more what and looked to have an obvious set of points.  Then I thought it had to be the mast light on top of a yacht or something and was thinking to myself, ""It's gotta be closer than you think!  Is gotta!""   I started to get my iPhone from my pocket but kept getting distracted by moving object that it took me a little bit to get it out and started taking pictures and video. I took a few photos that don't imply anything special and look like a star or something.  I took a short video of just around 2 minutes and the craft is clearly visible as the light I described.  It's hard to see the object moving because I was moving the camera. As my wife and I started to walk back the way we came (heading south, back towards the Hyatt hotel) and a ways away we came upon two women, in their 20's and I asked them if they could see that light and they started talking about how they had been watching it move and thought it was a planet or a plane too.  So we started thinking about what it could be but as we came up with possibilities, we could de-characterize the behavior of the object with common knowledge of planes and helicopters.  Most moving aircraft will have at least alternating flashing lights on each wing or the top/bottom of the craft. They also don't move in sharp, zig-zag patterns and erratic flight bahavior we saw.  Then the one of the girls said the same thing I thought about it being the light at the top of a yachts mast and that it could be closer than we think but we could see 3 yachts a couple hundred yards off shore very close to us that didn't have lights nearly as bright on top and they were not ! moving like the craft in the sky. We all watched it move out over towards the direction of Lahaina. My wife and I said a few things about the event with the 2 girls and headed back towards our hotel and didn't see the flying craft again.  The craft was obvious to us for about 20-30 minutes from when we first noticed the bright light to the point where we couldnt really see well any longer and headed back to the north side of Ka'anapali where our hotel, the Sheraton, is. We talked about what we saw and how cool it be to have finally seen a UFO. My wife asked if I was going to tell anybody about it and I said, ""I really want to! I don't know who to tell though!""  I asked her the same thing and she said &quot;Hell no! I don't want everyone to think I'm crazy!  Nobody would take it seriously anyway.&quot; I said &quot;that's true but we know what we saw!  That was awesome!&quot;  When we got back to our home on Oahu, we told our roommate and he started making jokes about it. &quot;Did it abduct someone? Could you see little green men flying it? Did you sing the melody (notes from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind')?&quot; and stuff of that nature were among the few jokes he said and even when my wife backed up my story, however reluctant, our roommate continued with his &quot;witty banter&quot;. I showed him the video I took and he still made fun of our encounter. I would think it to be very ignorant and nieve of us to think we are alone in the realm of all space and given that time is infinite in past and present, why wouldn't others have found us by now? It would be equally ignorant and nieve to think our government has flying craft, capable of amazing maneuvers etc.  I cannot explain what I saw as a common aircraft or ship and I know it happened and there were others there to share in this experience.

3,5,21,15 minutes,"6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night. I was driving south at approximately 8:45 PM on March 5, 2010, and my 6-yr-old daughter was in the passenger seat, singing a song. Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she'd been staring intently out the window). She said: ""Oh, wow"" or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride. We pulled into our apartment complex's parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn't believe what I saw.  It didn't make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO. My 6 yr-old's description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were ""dancing"" quickly.  To me, ""dancing lights"" fits well because the ""feeling"" I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light ""show"" was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights. Neither my daughter nor I could ""believe"" what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn't, it was real!   I'd turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn't seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too. The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.

8,13,21,~2 minutes,"Fiery red lights appear and disappear above the Atlantic, just off the coast of Tybee Island. On the night of Tuesday, August 13, 2013, two other adults and I visited the beach on Tybee Island, just off the coast of Savannah, Georgia.  We were standing near the pier when we witnessed several orange/red lights in the sky.   First one light appeared.  Seconds later two more appeared at about a distance of 3 or 4 times the width of the original light and to its right.  They remained absolutely still for several seconds.   Then the first light went out, followed shortly by the twin lights also going out.  Several seconds later, the twin lights reappeared as before, followed by the first light again coming on.  For a minute or so, the turning on and then off of these three lights continued.   There was no discernible pattern.  Sometimes the first light would come on; sometimes it would be the twin lights.  Whichever appeared first would be the first to disappear.  At no time was there any movement of these lights.  They remained steadfast in their positions,! appearing and then disappearing like fire in the sky. At the conclusion of the light show described above, there appeared yet a fourth light to the left of the original light’s position.  Then a second light moved to the left of this fourth light.  Then another light moved to the left of it, and another light to the left of that one.  As I recall, there were now four lights sitting in a row, perfectly still as though they were hanging from an invisible rod.   As one of my companions described it, it seemed as though the lights had been hiding behind one another, each taking a turn to move to the left and within our sight.  There they remained for several seconds and then they were gone.  We did not see them again, but we left the beach shortly after as there was a mighty storm approaching. Before the lights appeared, we had watched a distant fireworks show far up the beach to the north.  So it must have been between nine and ten o’clock.  The lights appeared about 65 degrees above the horizon.  They were straight ahead of us, out over the water.  We had earlier observed the lights of a distant barge, and the fireballs in the sky seemed to be closer to shore.  I remembered the lights as being triangular, but with rounded corners, more of an egg shape or oval.  One companion remembered them as being more circular, and my other companion said he saw “portholes” in each light. The lights we saw were beautiful.  They had an organic look, not like artificial light, but a warm glow like that of candle light in a pumpkin, but redder.  They emitted no beams, and were not reflected in the water below.   Some might think they were Chinese lanterns, but I know they were not.  It was a very windy night, and the only movement we saw was that of the final lights.

7,20,23,~2 minutes,"Sphere hovering over the ocean We were vacationing on Tybee Island and had an ocean front condo.  My husband was on the balcony at approximately 11:00 PM.  I opened the sliding doors to the balcony to join him.  I saw as I opened the doors a large ball of white light that appeared to be hovering over the ocean near the water's edge.  I asked him what it was and he said he didn't know but had been watching it for a few mins.   I moved to the left of the balcony to sit beside him and realized this object had no trailing light behind it.  We didn't believe it then to be a light from a ship and there was nothing notable on the water that we could see.  I hadn't been in my seat more than 3 seconds when it disappeared right in front of us.  I don't know which way it went because it went so quickly it left us really puzzled.  It didn't change colors but remained white the entire time before it was gone.   We just sat there not saying anything for some seconds and then we started to speculate as to what in the world it could have been.   My husband hadn't gotten up to come and get me because he was trying to figure out what it was, and he didn't want it to disappear if he made movement on the balcony.   He then said that it was much bigger than we probably realized and appeared to him to be farther out than I thought it was.  Its light was cast on the water underneath of it.  I especially wanted to ask my husband if he had seen any beam of light behind it and he hadn't.  He said it was solitary...just hovering there over the water.   This particular night I didn't see anyone on the beach and usually there were people walking with flashlights all through the night on that beach.  I have no idea if anyone else saw it.  I tried to remember if I had reported it here on this  site before but couldn't so I decided to report it just in case.  Needless to say I didn't sleep well at all the remaining nights.

9,1,13,5 seconds,"Black shere seen moving at high speed below the clouds in a straight trajectory I was laying at the pool with my wife on a partly sunny day.  At approximately 13:30, I was laying on my back with my feet pointing nearly due south.  I had on a pair of high quality polarized sunglasses that allowed me to look up into the afternoon sky.  I was watching cumulous clouds roll and build in the afternoon heat when a black object appeared in my field of view from high and right, moving down and to the left.  This would be a Southeast trajectory.  My immediate opinion was that the object was a large black bird, riding the wind at a very high altitude.   A split second after the object entered my field of view, however, the “Bird” appeared to have its wings folded in.  Birds who ride the thermoclines at that altitude very rarely flap their wings so I thought this odd.  I waited for the “Bird” to open its wings.  It never did. As I describe this at the luxury of taking the time to sit in my living room and record my memory of the event, please bear in mind, the entire event was over in approximately 5 seconds.  When my eyes became fixed and focused on the object,   I jumped up from my chair and moved to the right to prevent my view from being blocked by a tree that is next to the pool.  What I was looking at was a solid black sphere.  I got an extremely good look at the object and could judge altitude better as it passed under a large cloud.  My view was never obstructed by the cloud.   The object did not appear to have any lights on it, nothing flashing, and it made absolutely no sound.  It left no form of contrail, but at that low of an altitude, neither would a commercial or private aircraft.  No contrail, moved under a cloud so my estimation of altitude would be at or under 1000 ft. The direction of the object never changed.  It continued out of sight on the same Southeastern trajectory it was on when I first saw it.   I work in the aviation field and I am familiar with what a fixed wing and or a non-fixed wing aircraft looks like in the sky.  I also know that any aircraft I am aware of, short of a non-powered glider can be heard from the ground at a below-cloud altitude.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object appeared to be a perfect sphere.  There were no wings. I am not claiming the object I saw was of extra-terrestrial origin, but I know what I saw was no typical aircraft that I have ever seen before.","flashing lights red,blue,yellow",SENOIA,GA,SPHERE,2014,0.41389605,1.834654876,0,1.303120784,NA,0,0.0642725,1.361307845,1,0,NA,-0.911239024,0,-0.779388567,0,NA,NORTH,PARTLY CLOUDY

6,5,22,15 mins,"Shape changing light formations, and two hovering vessels, eye level, at very close range June 5th, 2008, around 10:15 p.m. EST,  My 13 year old son and I,  were driving south on, very rural, Hwy 305 about 2 miles into Burke County when an orange light appeared to the west of us, I noticed it immediately, but didn’t think that much about it until a second light appeared, and then the third.  The lights formed what I consider an isosceles triangle.  They disappeared in opposite order in which they appeared, within about 3 seconds.  This was neat, odd, but conclusive for me.  We traveled another 4 or 5 miles and again, 8-10 more orange lights appeared randomly spaced to the right side of the highway, this time appearing closer to the tree line.  After about 4 seconds they disappear.  By this time, we are consumed with speculation as to what could be making these lights.  We traveled less than 2 miles further, and again 8-10 orange lights appeared randomly spaced, and within less than a second they literally moved into a formation of two parallel, perpendicular rows.  I was driving, and could not witness as much as my son, who said it/they, moved into a triangular formation and disappeared again in about 4 seconds.  This is when it became apparent to me, this was real.  We are nervous and anxious to get home, since we are alone in the middle of nowhere.  We traveled another 3-4 miles, when the lights appeared again, but this time below the tree line, literally hovering about 20-30 feet above an open field.  This thing is less than 50 yards away from my car, and we can now see it. The very bright orange lights encompass the perimeter of the vessel that is hovering at an angle and slowly rotating counter-clockwise, illuminating the undercarriage which was a dark gray metallic.  My son witnessed a second vessel hovering above the one described, but said that one did not have lights. We did not stop or even slow down, but we continued to see it until we had driven out of viewing range. This last sighting lasted for about 12 seconds.  I did not report this to local authorizes.","Oval bright white light, traveling fast for about a minute, then disappearing.",KEYSVILLE,GA,CHANGING,2008,0.125373402,1.436210366,0,0.13028168,NA,0,0.0642725,1.421817698,0,0,NA,0.739669356,0,-0.065910295,0,-0.991561816,SOUTH,CLEAR

I estimate the object was above 20 thousand feet.  The day was sunny with very few clouds. The object was headed south in the direction of Atlanta City above the clouds.  At times the object reflected sunlight as it was a sunny afternoon.  I observed the object for about 7 to 10 minutes.  The object was moving at a steady rate of speed in the direction of Atlanta.  It did not move in an erratic way. There were no visible lights on the object.  It appeared to be the exact same color as the white clouds.  Eventually the object disappeared as I could no longer see it due to it's height and distance from me. The object was not easy to see.  I happened to notice it as I was watching an aircraft overfly my location.  The aircraft that overflew my location was a fly-over not on approach to Atlanta. The spherical shape just happened to catch my eye as it was bright white and well above the fly-over aircraft.  While the object appeared spherical in shape the bottom of the object appeared to be of a saucer shape and had a somewhat grey color.  The object was significantly higher than the flyover at my location but was not moving at the same rate of speed.

7,4,15,Don't know,"Caught a UFO object in a photo During the summer, I was walking up my street just taking some random photos. There was an empty for-sale house on my street and the sun was above it, behind some trees, so I thought it would make a good picture. I snapped a few photos and moved down and then went back inside. I downloaded my pics onto my laptop. I noticed as I was looking at one that it looked like a UFO in the top right corner. ( I will email the picture). The other photos I took didn’t contain the object. I think it looked like a flying saucer…there was no one outside that day and the house was empty at the time, and there is nothing but miles of woods behind the houses, so it wasn’t a Frisbee. I don’t think it was a spec or dust particle because I think I wiped my camera lense off before taking pictures. And if it was, the spec wouldn’t appear like that on the photo. The object is blurred, so obviously, it was moving fast. Although I don’t believe it is a bird, it very well could be. I really want some second opinions on my photo. It was taken with a Nikon CoolPix L14 7 megapixel digital camera. I don’t remember the exact time but it was on July 7th.

My wife, two small children, and I live in the north Georgia Mountains in an airpark community that sits approximately 3000 feet in elevation.  Being far away from any major city, there are no nearby lights to brighten the sky, so I can usually see numerous aircraft pass above, mainly jets.  On this particular night, we had been sitting outside approximately 30 minutes, when we saw a light passing from south to north at a speed that I estimate 20 to 25 times faster than the airliners flying overhead.  I said to my wife and children that obviously this was a satellite because there were no jets that I knew of that could fly at this rate of speed.  Also, we heard no sound and didn’t see any navigation lights. Anyway,  as I was telling my family what I thought this light was, it came to a complete stop right above our heads for a split second, then  made a right angle turn to the east at a speed as great  or greater than we observed  before it stopped.  Then we observed the unidentified object disappear into the eastern sky. The object we saw was a white light, not particularly bright or large. However, the rate of speed this object was traveling is what caught my attention initially.

After I finished smoking my cigarette, I decided that it was nice enough out to merit staying out there.  I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane; I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn't have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare; but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed; a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east; at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after. I'm reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn't able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I'm posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO. The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs.

10,11,18,3 seconds,"At around 6pm (18:00 hours) I was outside in the backyard of my home with my Canon EOS Rebel XT digital camera taking photographs of nature and the natural landscape.  At around the same time I noticed a small helium balloon (such as a party balloon) floating by up in the sky and decided to take a few pictures of it just on a whim.  After I shot the first picture of the balloon I noticed (through the view finder) a small white object moving rapidly from left to right within the view finder.  I quickly tried to take a second photograph of the object but was unable to as it vanished before I could focus on it accurately. However, when I came upstairs and uploaded all of the images I had taken into my computer I noticed that the second picture I took of the helium balloon had the strange white object within its frame.  I couldn’t help (and still can’t help) but wonder what the object could have been, as it flew very quickly and completely silently before it disappeared.  The sky was also very clear and there was no other air traffic that I could see within my vicinity. The photograph of the object was taken with the following settings: Shutter Speed:  1/320 sec.

One changed shape and both disappeared Approximately 9am 11/2/2009 I received a call from two of my workers on a job site claiming they saw two UFO's. They asked if I could see them from where I was. Not able to locate the UFO's I drove about 10 minutes to their location where I saw my two workers and about a dozen residents of the location on the 2nd floor of a high rise condo looking up. They described two objects, one bright red the other white, neither one blinking. One sitting still white the other circling. I always carry binoculars with me and was able to locate the two objects they described. The two objects were directly overhead, very high in the sky but their exact height was difficult to determine as there were no clouds, blue sky and no other aircraft in the area to allow proportion. My first thought was that the objects were lost helium balloons but it was unusual that one was motionless and and stationary while the red object seemed to drift away from the white object. After several minutes the red object drifted back toward the white object, follow a semi circle around the white object, drift away then disappear. Convinced these were balloons I left the jobsite, residents still looking skyward, drove about a mile, stopped my truck, called my wife who was about 5 miles from my location to see if she could see the remaining object. Not having a clue as to how large an object this was or how high I figured if she could see it that far away then a) we weren't imagining anything or b) the object obviously had some size to it. After telling her where to look she spotted it also. We both watched for about 15 seconds, her naked eyes and me though my binoculars when the object started getting very bright, change from a spherical shape to a more elongated cigar type shape, get very fuzzy or almost mirage-like then disappear. My wife described exactly what I was viewing through the binoculars. My workers radioed the same exact description. The object,which appeared to be white then silverish blinked, got very bright, dimmed, became elongated then fuzzy then disappeared. I tried to use my camera phone to record it but the objects were too high to get any type of accurate recorded visual.

Airplanes fly over our street probably 50 times a day and are generally pretty low to the ground before the gain altitude. Last evening I sat outside with my husband and neighbor while the sun was almost all the way set.  There was no particularly beautiful or colorful sunset.  In fact the clouds looked more of a muddy grey.  A plane took off and was probably right above the inlet when we noticed a bright orange, spherical orb glowing probably 20 ft. From the aircraft. At first glance we thought it was another plane, but logic kicked in and I quickly realized that there was no way two planes could fly so close to each other especially at such a low elevation.  We watched for a few seconds longer and the orb seemed to keep pace with the plane.  Then suddenly it begin to expand and the color turned it to a bright white blue color, and smoke spewed from all directions.  At this point the plane had gai! ned elevation and began to Veer off north over the Atlantic.  The small ord continued on its path at a low elevation until it disaperaed from our view.

8,7,20,3 minutes,"At approx. 20:30 hrs EST I watched a commercial aircraft transition (witnessed standard aircraft lights) from north to south just east of the Florida coast, at what appeared to be approx. 7,000 feet.  I was curious about that aircraft for two reasons 1.  I am a private pilot and generally enjoy seeing aircraft flying over and 2. I had watched my daughter and son-in-law arrive along the same track two nights ago while they were returning on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami (I had been watching their progress via the internet flight tracking software.  I looked up a couple of minutes after that aircraft passed to the south and saw another light in the sky at about the same altitude and location.  This light was white in color and looked like a landing light.  It almost looked like a satellite but without the speed one would normally see.   Within a couple of seconds I noticed a green light behind the white light (to the left of the light, or North).  A seco! nd later there was a sudden bright intensity that looked like a rocket separating from its booster, a bright center with the shape of a brilliant triangle with the original light at the tip pointing out towards the east.  The light shape lasted only a couple of seconds and then disappeared.  I lost sight of the light for a second or two and when I next located the same position in the sky there appeared to be two green lights separated by about ¼” at arms length.  The green lights remained separated by a fixed distance while the lights appeared to move towards the east.  Living in Florida for the past 40 years I’ve seen my share of rocket launches, this was in the wrong location for a rocket coming out of Cape Canaveral.  The shape and color of the contrail looked just like a rocket separation.  My best guess was a missile that was dropped from a launch plane, engine ignited and flamed out after a few seconds.  Very strange. I am a private pilot and retired Deputy fire chief.  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and monitor launch schedules from the Cape and satellite sighting via iPhone software.  This was the most unusual sighting I have seen, mostly because of the location being so close to West Palm Beach and the commercial airways to and from Ft.

I saw a blurry, short white line of faint, slow but steady flashing light, that appeared to be moving south to north amongst the top of the low clouds on the horizon.  At first I thought an airplane, but the light was too smooth, too straight, and low, plus we could not hear anything to reference that it was a plane.  A plane that close to the water would echo.  It was silent.  I said ""Someone on the pier must have a laser.""  It did appear that they were shining a little laser light into the clouds, moving it forward.   When it was at the point in front of us, it instantly changed course moving west to east under the surface of the water, directly toward us; dim, yet now, solid light.  Its size did not change as it moved toward us, coming from the horizon. As its distance closed in on us, about 20 feet away under the surface of the water, Kaitlynn grasped onto her chair handles like bracing for something, this was real.  The moment after she braced, it moved to the north a little and emerged about 10 feet away, 4 feet off of the ground, looking like a firefly, then gently hovering just over the sand.  It lingered along the shore momentarily.  Us, losing it in the darkness, like it was hiding it's light.  It came to check if we had noticed it, and we had.  We started to walk towards where it surfaced, but since it was not lighting up, we did not find it and had that certain feeling not to look for it any longer. I would think that it would appear to grow larger, the closer it came, true?  It's mathematical.  This did not change its size, although each atmosphere that it entered, it was a different and a constant other size.  In the clouds it looked like a small plane but mathematics ruled that down to someone pointing a laser echoing in the humidity of the clouds.  In the water it appeared as a quarter-sized white light, over the sand it was the size of a lightning bug and yellowish.  Kaitlynn saw a blue color at some point too. Prior to the sighting, I wanted to hear a song that describes the sky perfectly since it fit the moment.  A few lines are simple metaphors that we all can relate to.  I love lyrics like that.  ""...the sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it."" was this starry night.  The song is Incubus' ""I wish you were here.""  It goes on to say ""I'm counting UFOs, signaling them with my lighter ... and in this moment I am happy.  Happy.""  A few minutes later was the sighting.  This is real. Whatever it is was mind-blowing.  I don't know how else to describe it.","Double oval-shaped cigar shaped craft seen at high altitude, air traffic diverted",VENICE,FL,CHANGING,2016,0.387666719,1.487292996,0,0.921266192,NA,0,0.0642725,1.694112038,0,0,NA,-0.911239024,0,0.362176668,0,NA,NORTH,CLEAR

While taking out the garbage for next day curbside pickup at 22:00 hour (10:00 PM) on 07/11/2007, I spotted a very bright light in the sky in the direction of the Venice Municipal Airport in Venice, Florida.. It first appeared to be a planet like object similar to Venus in the night sky; however, much larger and brighter. I stood starring for about 5 minutes until I realized it was moving away from me as it began to drop below the tree top level.  I ran inside to get my binoculars and returned. It had moved only slightly. Viewing it through 6 X 30 binoculars proved it was not an aircraft (I see small aircraft with their red and green running lights every day & night since the Venice Airport is home to many private craft including jet aircraft).  Although in the direction of the airport I could easily determine that it was well beyond since I could see small craft landing during the event. I then decided to take a picture and ran back in the house a second time for the digital camera. By this time the object had moved some distance from the original sighting position so the pictures were barely discernible. I ran the pictured through my graphics software enhancing the object. It was circular in shape and emitted a bright glowing light as if it were a glowing white ball and appeared to be much larger than the small craft flying in the area. The event lasted approximately 15 minutes.

This evening around 10pm I went out to my backyard to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a very bright light in the night sky to the north of where I was standing.  At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed way too large and bright.  The object appeared to be stationary at this time.  I did see an airplane flying by in a NW direction, at what appeared to be a much lower altitude than the large light.  By comparison it's lights seemed exponentially smaller that the bright object in the sky that I was focused on. The two did not seem to interact in any way. As I watched it began to look more like 2 stars very close together, then the space between the white lights appeared to grow larger. When the horizontal distance between them reached a certain size, the object began to move south toward where I stood. At this point I knew it was not stars, so I thought it might be an airplane, but it seemed strange that it had hovered in one spot for so long before moving, not to mention the way the lights went from looking like one light only to looking like 2. As it flew over me relatively slowly, I could see it was a matte silver color, and triangle shaped with 2 larger bright white lights approximately in the center of it and 2 smaller ones that were closer together and directly behind the 2 larger ones. It did not have the flashing red or blue lights that you see on airplanes. These lights did not blink at all. I think I could hear it as it flew above me, but the noise was very low, not nearly as loud as any aircraft I've ever experienced that was flying that low. Also the sound was more of a deep low hum that the usual roar of an engine. And I think I almost felt the hum more than I could hear it. As it flew over the house. I ran back in the house, through the living room and out the front door. I should have been able to still see it somewhere in the sky, but it was nowhere to be seen.

These lights were more or less in a line stretching  about a fourth of the way across the sky as I watched them slowly move southward.  They were not tightly spaced but had about same space between them: K One........Two.......Three/ Four (these two were one above the other with roughly the same ....... spacing, and seemed to be trying to get closer to each other) then........Five. They must have not been that far away from me because they were quite bright and bigger than stars. I don't know where they came from I just saw them there in that line slowly moving north. At a certain point (which oddly corresponds to where the visibility from my vantage point is unobstructed when  looking at that part of the sky), the light of first object suddenly went dark, and after that when each of those objects reached that part of the sky they too sent dark. It seems that they may have continued on but moving east now ( but I could not be certain).This sighting occurred in Tampa, but in the Temple Terrace/Thontosassa area. These objects moved slowly, and I estimate I watched this for at least three minutes. I wondered if anyone else saw them? As watched it felt almost like they were putting on a show just for me as it took so long. I looked on-line, and it may be possible they were some sort of sky lanterns ( Chinese lanterns) as they are that color and move slowly. I can't be certain. I did not hear of any being launched. But it is a possibility. I always look up at the night sky and have never seen anything like what I saw ever before. However, there was a night  in the  summer  of 2009 in which I saw on roughly that same area of the sky  where the lights went off  in last nights sighting; a strangely churning white cloud ( at night).  I remember because I have NEVER seen a cloud churn and billow so fast.  On that night I got a chill because I was driving home listening to a man tell a story about Moses and the cloud appearing in the mountain, when, as I pulled into my driveway, I saw this strangely churning cloud directly in my line of vision.  It was late at night also and the synchronicity of what I saw  and heard made me run for cover inside my house. So for me, I guess,  that area of sky is indeed mysterious.  I softened wondered if behind that churning cloud was a mother ship.

I was in shock and embarrased at the same time,she then gave me the phone and the lady officer told me to hold on, i could hear other officers in the back ground on the radio giving a play by play of what this thing was doing,i heard one officer saying OH MY GOD, NO WAY one was being proffesional like a sports announcer,( WE HAVE VISUAL, ITS HEADING TOWARD T.R.A {Tallahassee Regional Airport}COPY THAT then one would say ITS HEADING TOWARDS THE FLEAA MARKET ON CAPITAL CIRCLE, the lady officer was ignoring me on the phone when i asked if everthing is ok, i then heard one of the officer's say DID YOU SEE THAT, then one came back on and said I CANT BELIEVE HOW FAST IT JUST TOOK OFF, one came back on and said it left like a bat out of hell. just as the officer was trying to hang up on me by saying WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT SIR, an officer came on the radio and said OH LORD ITS BACK, OVER THE FLEA MARKET, the whole time we are in the front yard still looking up but unable to see it because the flea market was about 10 miles away, the line went dead and she finally left to go home, the next day i told my Dad about what had happend and he looked in the newspaper to no avail, there was nothing, later on that day i called the sherrif's office back to see if there were any more details about the sighting, they  had no clue to what i was talking about.I did come across some correctional officer's who said they had heard about something that had happend but no exact details, so i guess it never really happend right?

The object appeared to be a bright star/light and would change colors from red, white and greenish blue. This was a very fast color change that took place. If you had blinked you would have almost missed it .  The object had appreard to sit idle for sometime in the sky as if were waiting for direction . While sitting idle hoovering in the western sky over the gulf of mexico, it would dim and then just about fade out completely and then become super brilliant in color , always maintaining a star/light like shape or visual appearance to the naked eye. Its movements were not what one would think an airplane could do almost zig zagged at times and seemed to disperse a very faint light like flare or a spark if you will , sent out in any direction.  After a few minutes I telephoned a friend who had witnessed the same type of star/light like object a week prior to what I was observing at the moment and had for the past 3 nights . I asked her to describe what her and her daughter had seen in the skys over Clearwater the week prior because I was watching an object that was very similiar in nature to what they had witnessed. (Clearwater is About 30 minutes from St.Petersburg.)  She described that same light pattern , Star/light like appearance of the object and the same idle and cruising pattern as I had observed and the movements of the object, we talked for almost ten minutes about the object as they searched the sky south west of their home for what  was being  described to them .  The object began to pick up speed and was out of my eye range in seconds (blocked by a ten story building) as it headed east north east over towards Tampa Bay .  Just then I spotted a second Star/light like object with the same pattern of lights, movement and flight path as the first. This object appeared out of no where just like the first had .  My friends couldnt see much due to the Clouds over their area. I wished them a good night and would keep them posted as to what was observed at night . I ended the call and researched on the pc about any sightings in this area or across the state of florida this month or the month prior . Your site had come up on the search and here is my post.  I observed a 3rd object just as typing this post was nearing an end . The object my friend had witnessed was reported to be in the AM some time around 4:30 am - 5:30 am .

Later on I found out that they would have been flying directly above a local police operation, a DUI checkpoint, and it seemed that they were openly trying to communicate with the police by flying directly above them and signaling in a very similar way to how the police cars were using their light array to flag down civilians who were suspected of drinking alcohol and driving or were driving faster than was the speed limit of that street, which is 45 mph.

Then a tree got in the way and I couldn't seem to find the light again, I even doubled back to where I had last been able to see it, but it was gone. I then looked to the other side of the road. It was here that I saw the first of the two crafts. It was travelling low and to the South at a very slow speed. It gave off a very low humming noise almost like a ver muted engigine, but unlike any engine I've ever heard, especially at such a low altitude. There were seven orange lights placed at distinct locations on the craft. Five were in a row in the central region of the craft and the other two were placed so the seven lights looked like a cross with the short horizontal line at an angle. The lights are represnted by the ""o"". -o- -o--o--o------o--o- -o-  The triangular shape seemed to mirror the shape of the lights, however that is hard to illustrate for you as i did for the lights... The craft moved from the right to left as you view the illustration. Then I lost sight of the craft for four to five seconds as I made a ninety degree turn onto another street. In this very short stretch of time, the craft had gone from flying parallel with me towards the south, to flying parallel with me to the west. Then I came to an area with ponds on both sides of the road, permitting a large area of sight on all sides of me. As I glanced to the left to see if there were any more of these ships, I saw another further away but also flying parallel with my cycling to the west. It looked exactly the same, only the two lights out of line were in the opposite position and it had a red light (illustrated by ""X"") as well. Looking like this: -o- -o--o--X---o--o--o- -o-  This craft flew from left to right, as you view the diagram. None of the lights flashed or fluttered at any point during the experience. Then the two ships sped up slightly and disappeared over the horrizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  Date is flawed.  Student report.

8,7,20,5 minutes,"Bright round lights appear in sky after the launch of the Delta IV Rocket @ Cape Canaveral. August 7, 2013   Dear Peter,  	 This evening at 8:30 PM, I was outside getting my horses in for the evening when I looked up in the sky and saw the curly white contrail of what I thought may have been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  I live in Sanford, Florida, and as the crow flies about 40 miles from The Cape.   I have a good view of any rocket launch and have viewed multiple shuttle launches right from my yard.  I was not happy that I had missed a launch--which later this evening I did confirm was a Delta IV rocket.  This time of year, 8:30 in the evening is still daylight and hot!   As I was looking at the curly contrail, I noticed a VERY bright round light to the left of the contrail.  It was not moving.  It was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am in the path of the airplanes coming and going from Sanford Airport. – so believe me, I know what an airplane looks like.  No stars were out yet.   As I was focusing on the bright round light, a line of smaller white lights appeared to the right of the large rou! nd light. It happened so quickly.  I am not sure if there were 4 or 6 round lights and I could not determine if the lights were parallel to the large white light horizontally or vertically.   For a brief moment, it seemed like I was looking at the lights through a sheer white curtain and what appeared to be an outline was visible which made me think that the smaller lights were actually part of a triangle shaped object.  It was brief and the thought or shape was no longer there but the lights remained. As I was watching the lights, I called my friend and neighbor to come outside to look too.  As it turned out, she was in her car driving to the grocery store about 3 miles away.  She was watching the white contrails and also saw the large white light but she could not see any more than 2 of the smaller lights.   We stayed on the phone with each other for about 5 minutes watching the lights and the contrail.  Oddly enough, above the contrail was a very strange cloud that appeared to be brightly illuminated as if there were lights inside or above where we could not see.  There were very few other clouds in the sky and none of them had the brilliance of this one. For all of this time, the large round light never moved nor did the line of smaller lights.  There were small planes off in the distance with their lights clearly visible.  As the white contrail began to disperse, a few of the smaller lights disappeared.  The bright cloud was still very bright.  The last 3 lights remaining were the large round white light and two of the smaller lights to the right of that large light.  Then all 3 lights just faded out.  The contrails faded and the very bright “cloud” was the last to disperse after I would say about 10 minutes ((NUFORC Note:  There was a rocket launch out of Cape Canaveral at 20:29 hrs. on this date.

8,19,21,10 minutes,"Orange spheres over centrral Florida. I was driving into my neighborhood last night at approximately 9:30, and was preparing to park my car in my garage, when I glanced up in the southeast sky at my roofline and noticed three glowing, pulsating, orange orbs flying slowly in a northwesterly direction in a large triangular formation.  As far as size perspective goes--they were the size of a typical pearl bead held at arm's length. I estimate they were traveling at a distance of about 10-15,000 feet and were completely silent and their airspeed was approximately 200-300 mph.  The objects’ color never changed. I watched the objects break formation when they were directly overhead and begin moving in a somewhat straight line, as they gradually disappeared into the northwest sky. This part of the sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. I then saw another of these objects traveling along the same flight path, approaching from the southeast sky, at which point, I ran inside my house to get my wife outside as a witness to what I was observing. We both watched this object through my binoculars as it headed in a straight line into the northwest sky.  Same estimated airspeed, size and distance as the other objects. Also, at this point, I noticed several neighbors down the street from us, standing in their front yards, watching these objects. We were both getting ready to go inside the house, when we noticed yet another of the objects, same size, flight path, speed, color, etc., traveling in exactly the same direction as the previously sighted objects. We watched as it gradually disappeared in the northwest sky. I estimate the total length of this sighting to be approximately 10-15 minutes. We waited outside for another 10 minutes but nothing else unusual was sighted. We are approximately 10 miles from Sanford-Orlando International Airport and are very used to seeing various types of commercial and sometimes military aircraft over the last 17 years.

At a distance (I’m not good at gagging distances,) I noticed a small pin point of what appeared to be a cloud.  It was tiny. This “dot” of cloud began expanding rapidly. It caught my attention and, while still staring at it, I called my mother. I pointed to the cloud and asked her to look at it, that the cloud was forming a fast pace. She did and, was as amazed as I was. A cloud formed out of nowhere! All of a sudden an object of some sort flew out of the cloud. My mother wondered if it was a bird. I responded: must be a huge bird, to be visible at that distance.  At that moment another object flew out of the same cloud that had just formed. My mother then ran inside grabbed her binoculars and watched as a third object flew out. The first object was heading towards us, the second headed East and the third, headed west. The objects disappeared in front of our eyes. They just banished. My mother told me that through the binoculars, the objects seemed to be metallic, triangular and looked reddish.  With the naked eye, it appeared round. It was a sunny afternoon with no clouds. The color she noted could have been the sun’s reflection.

1,1,0,15 minutes,"Port Charlotte Florida large procession of lights in various colors moves slowly in a loose, linear formation. The night sky was clear.  First sighted heading west – began as a triangle formation of three white “star” sized lights moving very slowly.  Next we noticed some lights were following behind the triangle.  Formation began to change to a somewhat wide cluster, dispersing the triangle shape of three lights at the front of the movement of lights and appearing as if they were all just part of a tight constellation of stars, almost imobile but still some small movement westward.  Anyone looking up at this time may have thought it was just a concentrated area of stars and thought nothing of it for the several seconds or minute it was formed this way.  The lights (at least 20, probably more) then began moving, still very slowly but more noticeably, and forming a narrower line formation which then curved strongly to head north-northwest.  They seemed to be flickering now in different colors occasionally as green, blue, red, and white, but mostly white, as they passed almo! st directly above us.  Sometimes an occasional brighter flaring of color would come from one of the lights; and sometimes they were no more than an average star brightness in white.  The catepillar-like loose, linear formation of lights continued north-northwest until they became too far away and 'dim' to continue to track.  There was no sound; no aircraft sounds.  The entire sighting lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.  We called our neighbors over to view – 3 adults and one minor child.

His hamster had passed and we were looking for a spot to bury her.  We looked up and saw what, a first, we thought was a tower with lights that we had not noticed before.  It was a bank of lights that were very bright and a bit blurry so I cannot be certain how many - I would say four or five, my son thinks three.  These lights were in a straight line and, as I said, we thought this was a tower we had not noticed before because the lights were very low in the sky. However, when we looked up again they were closer.  There is a small craft airport near us and had the lights been headed in that direction or coming from that direction I would have dismissed them - they did neither, however.  The craft was slow, much slower than a plane or a jet would have been especially at that altitude.  As it drew closer we could see that the object was triangular.  All of the lights were very bright, and all white. It passed over us s! lowly, seeming to get lower as it went.  Because the lights were so bright we were unable to see anything distinguishing other than the shape and an obvious metallic sheen.  As it passed overhead we heard a noise no louder than a semi would make passing on a highway.  This sound was much lower than any jet or plane - however small - I have ever heard.  We could talk easily in low voices and hear each other though it was quite close.  As it passed overhead we ran through the breezeway of our apartment and out to the front where we watched it - still extremely low - pass over some trees and out of our sight.  We watched the skies, and listened, for a full half hour but did not see it return.  We were concerned maybe it was some sort of plane that was crashing as it was so low but, as I said, it passed much too slowly to be a plane.

At first I thought they were lights atop electrical towers.  But as I drove closer, I noticed they were not attached to anything. I pulled the car over because I wanted to observe the lights for awhile.  They were traveling slowly, almost gliding, in a west to east direction.   Each one was a brightly colored orange light; they sparkled and were quite pretty. I looked to the west and saw that others were coming into my view. This was good because as the others traveled towards the night clouds, they disappeared.  The &quot;show&quot; lasted about five minutes and then they had all disappeared. I called my friend who lived on my street, and as I was close to my neighborhood, she was able to see them as well.  She also told me that she had seen them a couple of months ago but never mentioned it. After doing a brief search on the Internet,  I saw that these same objects have been sighted all over the country in the past few months, and there were reports from the UK as well.","Faint blue intermittent flash like a very distant star.

I took my sun glasses off because I assumed it was a trick of the sunlight on my shades.  I removed my glasses and stared at this unidentified floating object, intrigued the entire time it was visible.   The whole 3 to five minutes I stared at this craft it did not move. I was so curious about what I was seeing I couldn't blink or look away,  I moved around to view the object from several angles.  As I inspected the object and began walking towards where it was floating, it quickly vanished into thin air. It was a perfect blue sky that day 90 degree Florida weather.   I looked all around as I walked up to the location where I saw the craft hovering.  I would write it off as a reflection but I could see a thin gray object on top of this crystal clear object.  Also the area I saw it had no water sources and was filled with grass and pine trees.  I asked another woman who was walking behind me if she had seen the object.  She did witness the object I saw but didn't see the grey roof on the craft, she had only seen the crystal triangular shape hovering over the same area.  I have had other strange encounters that puzzle me.  These things happened to me years ago and I still try to make sense of it today.

I noticed what I thought at first was an aircraft, a small moving point of light in the sky.  Then I realized it must be at high altitude & therefore the light must be extremely bright.  I kept my gaze set on it; soon, I noticed this light was not flying in a straight path as an airplane would.  Rather it was travelling in a curve, as though a half-circle. It was moving very slow - slower than any airplane, especially one with such high altitude, would be flying.  There was no sound of an aircraft engine at any time.  It took about 3 minutes to circle (from my left-facing to right-facing).  I then noticed another similar light which at first I reasoned could be a star I had not noticed before.  I always look to the sky when I step outside & had previously noted the position of Venus and what was possibly Sirius or Polaris to my north-facing.  I couldn't see any other stars when I had first walked outside. The first light seemed to be headed towards the new light.  They then merged to where I could only see one light.  That light then disappeared.  Although I was astounded I didn't mention this to my roommate or his girlfriend in fear they wouldn't believe me or think I was crazy.

7,6,16,10 seconds,"A spherical object, approximately 60' in diameter, moving with jet-like speed and precision. July 6th around 4pm, I was in the backyard manning the bbq.  During this time of day in Central Florida, the cumulus clouds build and bloom up into the sky.   So as I flipped burgers I also kept an eye to the sky to watch the building cloud activity.  I noticed a group of black crows flying about as high as I have ever seen them fly, so I was just watching the black crows riding the updrafts I caught sight of what I thought was a dark jet aircraft flying horizontally above the cloud tops.  However, the jet was not what I expected.  Once I started to get a good look at it I became confused.  It was a perfect sphere shape.  A metallic sheen like polished LEAD.  I could not see any wings, just a round sphere object moving like a jet aircraft, straight on a path, then it slowed to nearly a full stop and took an unexpected turn downward tracing the outline of the cloud as it descended thousands of feet. I was wearing my polarized prescription sun glasses, and again I could not see any indications of wings. There was no noise at all, not a whisper and I was well within distance to hear a prop engine or jet.  When this craft took the downward turn it was diving at a faster speed, then it actually slowed down at the bottom of its dive and took a reverse angle turn into the cloud.  A human pilot would have blacked out from that maneuver. Approximate time of viewing the flight path was about 10 to 15 sec.  I kept staring at the cloud for the eventual exit with the assumed normal flightpath of a normal aircraft, but it never made an exit from the cloud.  I gave up seeing it again and I took the hotdogs off the grill and promptly went into the house to tell the family what I saw and after lunch drew up a photo illustration.  I used a photo taken from the same spot of a cloud very similar to the one with this craft. It was a good reference because it had a jet airliner in the scene and I could relate all drawing elements to that.   Lately, I used my skills as an animator to re-enact the scene as an animation.  The animation is very, very accurate to what I saw that day.  The animation plays several times allowing you to see it again and again.

7,5,19,5 minutes,"Very bright white light following a southern trajectory seen 5 minutes prior to Falcon-9 launch from Cape Canaveral I was heading out to my front porch, here in East Orlando, about 5 minutes prior to a Space-X Falcon-9 launch of the Intelsat 35e.  I am about 37-miles west of the Space X complex at Cape Canaveral, and can see the rockets quite clearly when they launch.  As I went out the door, facing east, I noticed a very bright light to the northeast rising upward, about a third of the way off the horizon, initially almost exactly the same speed and curved trajectory a rocket launch would follow to the southeast.  I was upset because I thought I had missed the initial launch.  I tried to shoot a digital movie of the bright light, but it did not come out as far as I can see.  I visually followed the light as it climbed and got smaller and smaller, finally vanishing at high altitude.  I was puzzled because the light was an intense white color, and usually rockets at low altitude display a bright orange flame, as I was thinking I had been watching the Falcon-9 launch, and I’ve seen many launches from the Cape over the last 10-years, and what I thought was the launch just didn’t add up.   A few minutes later, a 7:37 pm (1937 hours) I saw the bright orange flame of the Falcon-9 booster appear just to the southwest, as it climbed and started to leave a contrail as it went into the upper atmosphere.  What really puzzled me, is that I had the impression that the bright light seen a few minutes earlier had been moving a whole lot faster than the rocket after it gained some altitude, I’d say about 4-times faster.  I know they prohibit aircraft in the immediate launch area, and the bright light flew directly through it only a few minutes prior to the actual launch.  I thought maybe an Air Force jet had left the skid strip on afterburner or something, but I was in the Air Force and never saw an afterburner as bright as that.

5,10,16,8 minutes,"Three small white orbs flying erratically extremely high in a perfectly blue sky during broad daylight. I was laying down on the back of my truck, looking at the clouds.  It was a beautiful day, the sky was bright blue. I was watching birds flying by and then I began looking at the vast blue of the sky.  As my eyes adjusted to changing depths, an object caught my eye. It was a very small white orb. It appeared to be either emitting its own light, or reflecting the Sun's.  This is because it kept a constant color. At first I thought it might be a star or planet, since I'm quite unexperienced with object of the sky. However, the longer I watched it, the more I realized how high in the sky it actually was.  This was in contrast to passing planes, which looked very small from my perspective, and were still obviously lower than the object.  I know this because at one point, the object moved behind some clouds that were passing by.  At this point I really noticed how erratic its movement was; it slowed down and sped up; it was also moving in different directions. As I was! watching this first object, I saw another one very close to it.  This one was moving much faster in the same direction as the first one, and there was yet another one following that one at the same speed.  It appeared as if the third one was chasing the second one, as they were moving erratically. After around 8 minutes, they were all completely covered by a passing cloud, and by the time it passed and I could see the blue background again-  I had lost all sight of the orbs. Keep in mind all of this was occurring at a very high altitude and in a very small zone of the sky, as the objects looked extremely small from ground level. Although the objects were moving extremely fast (much faster than any airplane that was passing by AND they were farther up), they were not making a scene. I myself have near perfect vision and unless I was concentrating perfectly on the level of altitude they were in, they would blur away and disappear. It happened a few times if I looked in another direction, finding them again was a matter of focusing on very small spots on the sky and looking for motion in the peripherals. This leads me to believe that UFOs are more common than we think during the day, yet they are so difficult to spot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was surprised to see that a single rose colored oval object was in the photo and rays beamed from the sun.  So I took a second picture and this time there showed a con trail and the object was gone.  Weather conditions were overcast.  A slight rain before.

6,1,23,10-15 seconds,"Triangle ""glided"" over bilboard by my house for 8 scnds then vanished, pursued by 8 emergency vehicles 	I was smoking a cigarette in my back yard at night.  Suddenly everything went kind of silent and I had what I can only describe as a primal fear response.  Something just told me to get inside. 	As i walked up my five steps to the  backdoor, I noticed lights in my right peripheral vision.  I thought it might have been a  cargo plane, but as I turned to focus on the  lights I immediately realized it was not any  kind of conventional aircraft. 	It was illuminated by a bill board  allowing me to see the entire craft.  It was  illuminated by a billboard on the side of hwy 98  so i assume it was over santa rosa sound (i  live right by santa rosa sound on the other side  of hwy 98). 	It was huge, dwarfing the billboard  sign.  It had a white light on each corner of the  craft and an orangish reddish orb on the bottom  center.  I saw a row of smaller white lights  going down the side.  The body of the thing was matte black colored or very dull charcoal  grey.It was exltremely slow moving, maybe 2mph  from my point of view.  It looked like it just  floated kind of.Its direction was west to east. All of this lasted for about only 8 seconds, i was still standing on the top step of my  stairs.  At this point i was in complete shock and  felt as though all the blood had just left my  body.  My memory gets kind of blurry here because  of the adrenaline going on, but i openend the  door and yelled for my mom (im 22).  By the time i  looked back and my mom got outside  it was  absolutely gone.  And i mean this thing was HUGE  and just gliding completely silently pretty close to my house only seconds ago and then it was gone?! 	 We stayed out there looking for about one minute and then eight trucks of some kind  came flying down the highway,all with their red emergency lights flashing on top. They were  traveling together like a convoy in the same direction and location where i last saw this  triangle craft. 	It is important to note that i live  right by the southern boundary of Eglin Airforce  Base.  Also, the night before this me and my  mother witnessed a strange light at a much greater distance.  The bottom line is this thing  was huge, silent, moved impossibly slow, and was  something that  is absolutely unknown to me.

1,14,21,one second,"Nighttime one second observation of low level black silent triangle with lights over Gulf coast We were staying at the Best Western Motel, 8697 Navarre Parkway (Highway 98), in a second story room overlooking the sound to the south (and the Gulf beyond.)  I was standing on the balcony just outside the room door at the railing watching the sky.  It was very quiet and the only noise to be heard was from small waves rippling against the beach below.  There was a very light breeze at the time.  There was broken, widely scattered, low level cloud cover-- very thin, wispy clouds, and stars were visible for the most part through them.  (It was difficult to estimate the actual altitude of the clouds, as they reflected the glare of the city on the underneath side and it made them seem as if they wer 500 to 1,000 feet up; however, similar clouds observed during daylight appeared to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude.) There was no moon, and the sky, particularly directly overhead, was otherwise crystal clear.  Horizontally, visibility out to the gulf was unlimited.  This was the second successive evening that I had stood on the balcony watching the sky for any action (I know this area experiences  a high number of UFO reports.)  I suddenly noted movement to my left.  I observed a triangular black craft at approximately at the 11:00 o'clock position to my left.  The craft had a single white light at each corner and a slightly larger, brighter light in the center.  The craft's corner lights were relatively brighter than the other stars.  The craft was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon and was proceeding in a straight line due west.  I observed it as it crossed my field of view until it was obscured by clouds at approximately the 2:00 o'clock position to my right. The craft traversed this space in approximately one second and was completely silent.  There were no other lights, e.g., red/ green wingtip running lights, otherwise visible.  The craft was flying above the clouds, but appeared to be at a relatively low level of altitude.  Again, it was very difficult to estimate accurately, but if I had to guess, I would say absolutely no higher than 5,000 feet.  I immediately raised my arm to estimate the approximate size of the craft by spacing my fore finger and thumb.  I did this repeatedly and concluded an approximate width of one and 1/4 to one and 1/2 inches.  I continued to watch but did not again see the craft, and within 30 minutes the cloud cover continued to build to the point that further observation was pointless.  During a three day stay in Navarre, I also observed a variety of Navy military aircraft in the vicinity, including ""Huey"" med-evac choppers, Marine Sea Stallion choppers, and an executive jet skimming the coast line.  All aircraft flew at relatively low levels, 1,000 to 3,500 feet.  Navarre lies between Pensacola Naval Air Station and Eglin/ Hurlburt Air Force Base, and a wide variety of military aircraft fly in the area daily, both day and night, including the USAF F-117 Stealth Fighter.  The area is also known for conducting a wide variety of research and development activities, tests, evaluations, etc.  I don't think the craft I observed could have been an F-117, as its shape varied (more triangular) and there were no running lights.  While the Stealth i sconfigured to fly with minumum engine noise, there was absolutely no sound from this craft, and at that altitude in such a quiet setting, I believe I would have heard a jet engine.  By way of background, I am 62, a retired Air Force officer (Lt. Col., 25 years service) and have observed a wide variety of aircraft, US and allied, military and civilian, under varying conditions.)","Extremely bright flash of light, lighting up sky in front of me and my wife with no clouds or thunder or sound",NAVARRE,FL,TRIANGLE,2007,0.72864803,0.322609044,0,NA,NA,0,NA,0.846974092,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,1.028089722,0,NA,SSE,OVERCAST

Venus was very bright at about 20º from my southwest horizon, and the light was heading in that direction until it stopped, remained stationary for a few seconds, then began reversing its course to the north.  As it did so, the light began strobing brightly, but no other lights were noticeable.   As the light passed behind a tall neighborhood tree which blocked my view, it apparently again stopped, for it never emerged from behind that tree.

My memory on the date is the only thing that is foggy, it was either 2009 or 2010, making me either 19 or 20.  The sighting occurred at approximately at coordinates 30.741037, -86.987174 on Steel Bridge Rd. in Milton, FL, which is right beside Whiting Field Nas-South.  2 of my friends and I had arrived to the area in the afternoon, maybe 2-3 pm, to set up a campsite for some other friends that were joining us there later that evening.  Steel Bridge Rd. itself is used mostly by the local canoe rental company as a drop off point into Blackwater River, and isn't really a campsite per say.  There must have been the off season (Fall or Spring) because the road was usually very busy with river goers, but no one was on the road that day.  Seeing as we weren't really sure about the legality of camping at the time, we had parked farther down Steel Bridge Rd. and were walking towards the river (East of where we parked) with a tent, a couple chairs, etc. We were about by said coordinates, when I looked up to the tree line to our right and noticed what could only be described as a stereotypical flying saucer.  It was fairly small only slightly larger than a car or truck, maybe roughly 20-30 ft in diameter, and silver in color.  It was a disk shape, but had a slight dome in the center that could maybe have fit 2 - 3 people.  It was hovering maybe 10-15 feet about the pine trees, and making NO sound whatsoever.  I pointed it out to my friends and we couldn't help but start laughing and pointing at it out of shock as it looked like nothing we had ever seen before.  There was absolutely no way it could have been anything besides a 'flying saucer.'  It was well lit outside and we could clearly see the craft as it was only 100 - 200 ft from us.  As we were pointing at it, it must have noticed us as well because it went from a totally stationary position to moving towards the river, where we were also heading (Eastward).  It moved under 5! mph in a seemingly straight line, staying about the treetops, and not venturing over the road.  I looked down for maybe a split second (probably to see where my phone was to take a pic) and looked back up and it was already about 300 feet away.  And then it was across the river and out of our sight over the tree line in a matter of a couple seconds. It was in the middle of the day so it really didn't feel creepy to us at the time.  We were more astounded than anything. The next morning, we woke up to the sounds of ""Reveille"" being played on horns, and it sounded like it was coming from the east side of the river which was the direction the UFO flew (we were camping on the west bank).  The Naval Air Station however was about 5 miles southwest of where we were camping.  I make this note because at the time I thought the horns were just from the Naval Air Station, but as I've thought about it, this really doesn't make any sense.  Not only did the horns sound MUCH closer than 5 miles away, they sounded like they came in from the direction where the UFO flew, which was in the opposite direction of the base.  Maybe they were camping out in the woods experimenting with with the aircraft? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I figured it was a plane, then noticed its altitude in relation to the overhead planes leaving the airport to that of a satellite.  Then I thought to myself satellites move in a straight line. As the object came over the beach it began to make erratic movements like slightly back and forth, left to right and in circles.  Still this looked like a satellite, but it was changing speed and direction like nothing I'd ever seen in the sky.  I pointed it out to my friend and she said the same, it looked like a satellite, then when it started moving in circles she said, ""what the hell is that?""  Again this looked like a satellite or star, but moved more like a drone of some sort.  It was way to high to be a drone though, again planes passing were below it.  It seemed somewhere between the stratosphere and mesosphere, very high up. No flashing lights or anything, maybe a weather balloon?  My friend and I had seen anything in the sky move the way it did. I went into the water and came back to see if I could find it again with the stars.

There was a diverse variety of cloud formations on the horizon and clouds were passing overhead.  The Southeastern sky was clear and blue except for some very shear cirrus clouds to the Northeast.  The conditions were very good: light Southerly winds, low humidity, excellent visibility.  I was starting to look Southeast when suddenly a bright light caught my eye.   I thought at first that it was a high flying plane reflecting the noon day sun.  There were several flashes of light that moved in a Northeastern direction in a nearly flat trajectory.  I saw a bright white spherical object traveling at a speed that can only be described as impossibly fast.  It appeared seemingly out of thin air and I was somewhat startled by it.  It went from a high speed to slowing down and as it moved across the sky, it looked like it either flew into, or behind the cirrus clouds.  It also had an aura that became more pronounced when it interacted with the high level clouds.  It stopped for moment and then disappeared.  It happened very quickly, but I got a good look at it.  A strange feeling came over me as I realized that I had never seen anything like that before.  To further describe: I was sitting at sea level and I was looking skyward 45 to 50 degrees from the Southeast horizon.  It appeared as a bright light that also flashed a few times.  It looked like it was at a very high altitude, which would mean that what I saw had to be of substantial size.  It moved a good distance in what could have been no more than a second or two.  The spherical shape became more apparent when it slowed down, however it was still moving quickly.  When it stopped, it remained stationary momentarily, then it vanished.

8,11,23,Approx. 5 mins.,"Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights Back in 2007, on a clear August night, I saw something in the sky that arrested my attention. My eyes locked on it as I tried to come to terms with what I was looking at. I was sitting in my car, engine off, driver's side window down - across the field from the elementary school I attended as a child - smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio. By pure chance, I turned my gaze out the window and upwards as I expelled a plume of smoke from my lungs, and there they were . . . Four reddish orbs, hovering substantially low in the sky, as silent as the surrounding night. They were NOT equidistant from each other but nonetheless arranged in a matter that allowed me to conclude that they formed the frame of an aircraft of some sort. Their placement in relation to one another seemed to suggest, to me, to form a shape of a triangle . . . the lights themselves forming an obtuse angle, stretching from left to right. The four lights were more left to right than up and down, and again, were NOT in a straight line, but formed an angle. Upon first setting eyes on the spectacle before me, I immediately shut off my radio. I have no recollection of radio interference whatsoever. If there had been, I'm sure I would remember it. There was no sound of traffic in the distance, as it was rather late at night and I wasn't anywhere near a main road or highway but tucked away in a residential neighborhood, blocks from my own house. The object was dead-silent and hardly moved, if at all.  The individual lights themselves didn't budge, nor flicker, blink, dim, or brighten.  Their illumination was constant. After staring up in utter awe for a few minutes, I looked away and reached for another cigarette, found my lighter, lit up, and then returned my eyes to the sight, at which point the lights were much further up in the sky, retreating into obscurity (and thus not as bright as they had been), and soon disappeared altogether. My best estimate of the time duration of my sighting is 5 minutes tops. I don't know what I saw that night, and not being a professional in the field of UFOs I don't pretend to identify what I saq but just merely describe what I witnessed.  And I will say this . . . in the faces of all those that might henceforth attempt to explain away my experience as if they had all the answers . . . I SAW WHAT I SAW AND NONE OF YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.  When you stop and think about it, where we're at in reference to UFOs, that's really all that can be said about a UFO sighting, isn't it?

4,17,17,10 to 15 minutes,"Appx  20 or more twinkling star like objects traveling north eastward over Miami on April 17, 2011. On the evening of  the 17th of April, 2011 at approximately 5:40pm I observed 3 small points of light in the sky just underneath very dark clouds.  At this time we were driving west bound on SW 88th St (Kendall Drive) and the objects were high in the sky.  Since we were driving home I lost sight of them.  About 2 minutes later we arrived in front of our home, I ran out of the car to see if I would see the objects and found a spot  near the lake for a clear, unobstructed view.  It took me a few moments before I saw 3 star like objects in the sky headed in a north westerly direction.  They looked to be twinkling or flickering on and off and also seemed small and orb like.  As I stood there more and more began to appear. The weather conditions were very cloudy with dark to light grey clouds in the sky, but as you looked west it seemed to be clearing up and plenty of sun light was coming from the west.  I believe that the sky was clearing just over and around Shark Valley Everglades National Park.  I believe this is important because I realize now that this was most likely the cause of the objects appearing to twinkle or flicker.  They seamed to be metallic and able to reflect or shine light from this source.  In addition, I would like to mention, that it was not raining. The direction I was facing on the lake was north. At first all I saw were objects to the north that seem to just disappear  into the clouds once they hit the northerly point, but then I started to look further to the east and noticed that the objects would begin appearing exactly 90 degress from the north ( towards the east) and I was not able to track them coming in from further south. I also realized that the new local hospital was having its grand opening and started to think it might be metallic balloons from the hospitals grand opening.  Only problem was that these objects were traveling fast and appearing high in the sky in the east as a small twinkle and then, although small, as they traveled north east they would look slightly larger in size having enough mass I could more easily follow the objects.  Just to make it clear I was facing north and my arms spread to a 90 degree angle (left arm directly north, right arm east). I had to question myself about the possibility they were balloons and check myself, but I have seen runaway balloons and they were not.  The movement was steady and fast and they all seemed to travel along just right underneath the clouds. These objects seemed to be coming from a distance near the turnpike (5.4 linear miles)  on Kendall Drive from my home and traveling north east towards the casino. I also noticed airplanes on their normal flight path over the everglades near the casino area heading towards Miami International Airport for landing. In comparison these objects, I believe, were much smaller making them appear farther. From the moment they appeared on the east to the moment they disappeared in the north it only took the objects 30 to 40 sec from point to point. Some of them looked to be traveling a bit faster than others at times. In total I saw approximately 20. Please also note I could not hear sounds from these objects like you would fighter planes. Near by is Homestead Air Force Base, but had these planes flown by you can easily see it’s a plane. I checked the wind direction on-line at:   http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=MIA&hour=06&course=azimuth   The winds at that moment and using a 6 hour forecast were all pointing east, from 3000 feet, and south east in higher elevations.  Had these been balloons they would be traveling against the wind. I hope this has been helpful.  My 15 yr old son was with me and witnessed seeing some of these objects as well.

7,7,22,7 min,"7/7/08  10:05 pm-ish  A Triangle sighting... Tampa Palms (North Tampa) Florida on Bruce B. Downs at Super Walmart.  I was walking out of WALMART, and I saw a bubble... or so I thought. At first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50' ahead of me. I kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as I stared at the bubble I wondered ""how would a bubble survive out here too long? I walked expecting to see it burst any second. It didn't. As I watched it... I then saw it wasn't a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. I stood next to my car. The attached photo is my Photoshop rendering of what I saw, and its pretty accurate.  It had been cloudy and drizzy, and there was a low canopy of clouds. I noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third in front. No lights blinking. The lights were very clear, and not like you'd expect headlights on a plane. I listened for sound and heard nothing. Then I suspected I was seeing something unusual. I then checked and nothing blinking, no stobe, no red beacon. The lights were not REAL bright but were very pronounced resolution-wise... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. The blueish round lights seem to be directional, like laser light travels, defined. The seemed about 2.5 or 3 feet in diameter. Then as it started to get over top and past Walmart I knew it was not a plane or chopper. I suspected it was a Black Triangle and I watched to see SOMETHING that would reveal it. Then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to STOP... it ascended straight up. I appeared to travel UP faster than it did since I spotted it traveling a horizotal flight path. As it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn't turn nose up to ascend. The bottom stayed facing the earth. It went up what looked like around 700-1000' until it pierced the cloud cover and disappeared.  It made no noise. I detected no outline/SHAPE to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. A plane climbing like that would have made noise!!! This thing moved silent;y and very SMOOTHLY. It matched the Triangle video taped at Wesley Chapel a couple months ago...

I knew there was something else to this object that was more than just strange. It seemingly began to rise but only noticable because there were points of reference on the ground that made it seem to be going higher. A jet passed a good distence above it. It continued to move West and higher in the sky as I followed it.

The object was flying across the sky horizontally towards the downtown area, the rate in which it was moving looked faster than any fighter jets that i have seen flying. The back object was moving rather fast, however there was no sound or flashing lights like airplanes, jets or helicopters have.

The following is a more complete description, with links to all 4 videos, but the originals are too large to attach here.  Feel free to append this to, or replace the original report. 11/9/13  Inverness, Florida   I saw approximately 10 bright orange objects passing from east to west, somewhat south of my location (Lat 28.8731 N  Long 82.3606 W).  All of the clips are really dark (sorry, shot at night), so they are best viewed full-screen, on a large monitor.  It will also help if the room is dark.   I recorded a total of 4 videos, some, when viewed in the original format, display terrestrial reference points. However, video enhancement would probably show trees, and such, on all of the clips.  Each video is of different objects, with some clips showing multiple objects at the same time. Each video was shot using a Nokia 928 cellphone, with an 8MP camera.  They are all recorded at 1920x1080 resolution, at 30FPS.  The file names show the dates and times that each was recorded.  The earliest recording started at 19:44:56 EST, and the last started at 19:49:28 EST.  The cellphone was held in the vertical position (long side from top to bottom), so when viewed in a video player, the clips may appear sideways.  If viewed sideways, east will be at the bottom of the screen, and the top of the original clip will be to the left side of your screen. The objects did not pass all at the same time, in any sort of ""formation"".  They passed during a couple minute period, at somewhat varying separations, and they seemed to vary in distance, but they all did appear to be tracking on parallel courses.  To the naked eye, the objects were a fairly bright yellow-orange, and the general appearance did not appear to change with the viewing angle.  It looked the same approaching (from the east), when they were  even with me (looking directly south) and departing (to the west).  The trajectory of every object was straight, there were no sharp turns, or zig-zags.  Any perceived movements of that sort, in the videos, were due to my inability to hold the cellphone steady.  Where the objects appear to stay in one place, ""hovering"", this is due to me doing a better job of panning with it, All objects continued moving at a steady pace, and did not stop. 19:44:56  This video shows at least 3 objects.  The bright white light is the moon,  At some point, near the end, my neighbor's porch is seen. 19:46:20  This video shows one object, passing over the roof line of the neighboring apartment.  The light colored area, near the top, at the start of the clip, is the eave of my apartment. The lighted area is on the neighbor's porch, the bright white light, in the upper left, near the end, is the moon. 19:48:36  This clip has no obvious points of reference, and also displays ""streaking"".  The movement is due to me moving the cellphone, not amazing maneuvers.  I tried to pan with the object, as it crossed the sky, but that is not apparent. 19:49:28  This one shows a single object.  It appears that I was fairly successful at keeping it centered, as it moved.  The object was definitely moving, from east to west, and fairly quickly. There was no apparent sound, associated with their passage, nor any debris tails (like with meteors or space junk burning up). There were multiple witnesses to the event.  I was with someone, and I also heard other nearby voices, in the area, making statements about what was seen. As suggested, I have uploaded all 4, uncompressed videos to the links shown below.

Slightly north of the moon's expected rising point, at about 80° to 75°Azimuth, I saw what at first I thought were Venus and Mercury in a formation I saw two years ago in Bogotá, Colombia, when Mercury was seen above and to the left of Venus in the city's southern night sky.

It had a lot of lights on it many different colors.  Very bright white/silver, green maybe others, not sure.  The white/silver lights were constant and there were others blinking.

The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.

I simply cannot recall when it was but I wanted to report this hoping that it may help in some way, some how, even if the significance is miniscule. I was parked with a friend off the road on the Clearwater Causeway. We were facing NE and it was later in the evening. My friend was facing me, and I was looking out over the water. The sky was a beautiful deep purple and was very clear. What happened played out very quickly. So quickly, that I did not blink. A bright blue light appeared in the sky. It just appeared, but then quickly got a slight bit larger, as if it was heading towards me. It had to be extremely far away. It was small, but at the same time it was huge compared to what a passing plane would be, or a helicopter. By the way it was not a helicopter light. I have never ever seen a light that strong or in that bright blue color in the sky before. It stopped and then went up and backwards like in the shape of a slight arch until I could no longer see it. It moved so fast that there is no other technology I can compare it to. You could tell it moved a vast distance when it left. I have tried to find what skeptics would call a ""logical"" explanation, but I cannot find one. I believe what I saw was a UFO. I have never seen anything before this occurrence, nor after, so far.

Event occurred during the duration of time it took to drive between approximately Drew Street up to SR. 580. I noticed a single light grey-almost white craft flying very fast from east to west, very high in the sky.  Gauging by its position in the sky, it appeared it could have been over Palm Harbor/Oldsmar area. Initially mistook as a high altitude aircraft heading to Tampa Airport, when it started glowing extremely and unnaturally bright for approx. 5 seconds, as the bright light dissipated, it resumed a more normal greyish looking oval craft.  During the brightest part, it looked more circular in shape. Even in daylight, it was extremely bright. A few seconds later I noticed a translucent dark haze appeared to materialize and grow around the craft.  It was perfectly oval around the craft, and much larger than the craft.  The growing dark haze around the craft started losing transparency, and the craft became more obscured and very dim to see. The dark haze around the craft moved with it at the same rate of speed.  There was no contrail from the craft, nor did the surrounding haze have a contrail, say as smoke would if an engine blew on an airplane.  The craft became very difficult to see due to the thickening dark haze surrounding it, and when it flew into a nearby cloud, it did not come out. Less than a minute later, an actual high altitude airplane (appearing to be) heading for Tampa airport flew on what appeared a very similar flight path.  It had a contrail, when it banked, I could clearly make out airplane wings, unlike the craft preceding it. It also appeared to be flying at a much slower rate of speed than the first object.  The airplane appeared to enter the same cloud as the first craft, but it came out the other side, whereas the first craft did not exit the cloud on the other side. I am unsure if anyone else saw this.

On Tue Jan 24 around midnight (new moon, clear skies) my husband was walking a letter to the mailbox when he saw something strange in the sky and called me to come see.  It was very far away, hovering just above the tree line.  It appeared as a very bright star that continuously blinked with all colors.  We watched it for at least 15 minutes as it hovered and occasionally moved erratically left, right, up down, back and forth.  After observing for some time we ruled out the possibility of it being a star, a satellite, a plane, a helicopter or a balloon because none of those objects have the ability to make the kinds of movements that this object was making. It was very far away and all we had to magnify with was a pair of binoculars. In the binoculars it appeared as a pinpoint (orb) and was very far but closer than a star appears in binoculars.  When it went below the tree line we drove to a local field to continue to observe it.  It was still there but appeared to have move further south.  It was still too far away for us to be able to clearly identify it.

I couldnt move, finally he yelled at me again and I turned around and looked and yes it was there in the road behind us.We raced away 90 miles an hour.

3,17,0,ongoing-present,"The objects do change from one type to another.  They appear every night; rectangular, round, long stream of lights. This is a summary of what my husband and I have witnessed and observed on our home security camera system since March 17, 2017, when we first observed a strange rectangular string of very bright lights, attached to what appeared to be a metal bar, in the southwest corner of the backyard, picked by the video on camera #7.  The string of lights appeared to be an ordinary light one would have in a shop; however, it is only visible on screen of the video recorder.  When we look outside, the lights cannot be seen with the naked eye. This summary does not address a single sighting, but is current and on-going almost nightly since April 8, 2017, when we first began to monitor and document observations of the nighttime activities, taking place around the property on a regular basis and have replayed and captured quite a few pictures and videos, documenting what we have observed today to date. Since we first began to observe closely on April 8, 2017, it has gone to another level in terms of the entire operation.  It appears that it has become an invasion of our property, now we are seeing strange creatures that cannot be described as humans as we know them.  They are very small in stature, fly in appearing as birds, brightly lit all over, and changing into circles and into small creatures with human characteristics in terms of movement, but definitely not human. When they come in they appear to be carrying out what appear to be specific  pre assigned tasks, prior to the larger equipment, consisting of very long strings of lights that appear to be controlled by something or someone to turn on and off periodically, as they approach the property.  Initially, they were coming from the trees on the west and the north sides of the house, only. Now they are coming from the southwest most of the time, and the West and North some of the time. There appears to be space ship! s and/or aircraft type objects characteristic of but different, i.e. Smaller, but able to light up a large area when they appear.  (Modes of travel) involved in the operations.  Sometimes the forerunners come in as a large brightly lighted circle or rectangular object.  From what we have observed, they come in as workers, here to do a job. They appear to be well coordinated and work in conjunction with the other objects as they come in.  As a part of the preparation, they appear to spray an unknown substance that look like snowflakes and appear to turn into hale or sleet resembling crystal flakes.  When they are in the completely screened pool area they release some type of substance into the water before the others come in.  Sometimes when it rains, we see many of something dive into the pool, which is completely enclosed, with no opening, except the locked doors. They have attempted to remove the small Weber grill from the pool area unsuccessfully. It is difficult to explain what we are personally seeing because it is monumental.  I must mention an incident that happened on May 6, 2017, at approximately 11:30PM when a laptop computer vanished from the reception room, while we were removing items from the car, which was parked right in from of the door.  The laptop was placed on a credenza inside of the reception area; it disappeared and has not been seen since. On the morning of May 29, 2017, at 5:39AM, we were seeing family off who were taking a trip in their automobile; we were in the driveway assisting them in re-arranging some of the articles in the car to make more room.  While we were outside, we did not hear or see anything or anyone, However, on replay of the video, The unidentified objects were flying all over our heads the whole time we were outside, approximately 30 minutes. I have looked for every possible logical explanation to understand what is going on.  Have researched the internet on aliens, demons, religion, witchcraft, national security, etc.   All I can explain is that the activities are very organized, comparable to an army, and there appears to be what I have determined to be the captain or director, who is always present.

This was the third night in a row that I had been out because of what I had seen two nights ago.  The weather was totally overcast and dead calm, but there was sufficient moonlight to see the horizon of the entire Gulf of Mexico.   The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.  At approximately 9:45 a dim yellowish light appeared on the horizon just a little west/seaward of where I previously had seen the football shaped craft on previous nights.  I then got it in view with my binoculars and again saw two of the whitish-gold craft, side by side, right on the horizon at the water’s surface.  I think that they could have possibly come out of the water based on what I previously seen, except that these objects were fully formed – I did not see the little ‘blob” of light get bigger and turn into the craft like I’d previously seen.  I watched these objects for a short while as they pretty much stayed in place before disappearing.  At 10:13 p.m. I saw to the NNW of me, in the same area that the previous nights UFO’s appeared, a brilliant, “crystalline,” green-blue, flashing light, about the size of a pea at arms length.  It was no more than 4 or 5 miles away from me, well inside of the horizon.  It would come on for a short second, go off for a short second, etc. 5 to 7 times each time it came on.  It would stay off for perhaps a minute or two before coming back on.  After the first 4 or 5 times that it came on, it started slowly getting dimmer, and then I realized that it was moving way from me, just west of NNW, at an angle out to sea.  I watched this object for about 20 minutes before the !#@#%! Sand flies drove me off the beach.  I quickly went home across the street, soaked myself in OFF, and went back to my location.  By this time, 10:40, the light had turned mostly white with a bit of green in, and was barely visible with the naked eye.  It was still within the horizon though, close to 7 miles away.  I was watching it with my binoculars when the flashing became a consistent on and off, in a strange way.  It would take a long second to come on to the brightness that it would get, like on a slow dimmer switch, and then go off like a switch was thrown.  stay  I was somewhat, and the thought that came to mind was that it was “struggling, huffing and puffing,” getting to where it was just visible with my binocs.  Then, and this was scary, it brightened one last time and stayed on for a full second, and “shot” what looked like a short beam of light, or the light from some kind of a projectile, nearly straigh! t up in the air!  The section of “light beam” that I saw was maybe 60 to 80 feet long, perhaps even longer, as it was some distance away.  I guess it resembled the flash that comes out of the muzzle of a gun.  With 0 degrees being straight up, I would say that this short “beam flash” was at 10 degrees off of vertical, and toward the NW.  It seemed like the flash was going away from me and to the left a bit – it was very clearly defined.  I heard no sounds and it rather shocked and scared me when this happened.  I saw nothing else for about 10 minutes and I was glad to go home.  I’ve been lucky enough to see some really strange things out here, and even seeing a “normal” UFO seems like it would have been better that this.  I have absolutely no clue as to what it was that I was watching, especially considering that it changed colors and changed its rate of pulsations.  To think that it may have shot something up in the air just frightens me.  While writing this report, and after having thought about it for a while, the color of this light was greener than the blue-green light I had filed in “Sighting #9” for July 12, 2013.

The weather was partly cloudy, no wind, with visibility nearly unlimited where the sky was clear of clouds.  There were several jets, common at this time of the evening, coming in from the northwest toward the Ft. Myers International Airport  At 9:46 p.m. I saw what I at first thought was the bright headlight of an oncoming airplane just inside of a cloud, due west of me, approximately 55 degrees over the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The light was bright enough, about the size of a large grape at hand’s length, that it should have popped out of the cloud almost as soon as I saw it.  It did not.  I watched the light both with and without binoculars for about 4 minutes before it faded out.  At 10:08, just below the same cloud where the light was shortly before, I saw one of the amber-orange UFOs (aka fireballs) that I’ve reported on many times before.  Unfortunately, I was not looking directly at that part of the sky when it came on.  I watched this light for several minutes, both with and without binocs, and could confirm that it was precisely the same kind of UFO I’ve seen before.  The UFO slowly drifted downward to about 10 degrees or less above the Gulf, and then slowly faded out.  I observed this UFO almost exactly where I saw one on July 26, which I reported in “Sighting #14.”  Of great interest, this UFO dipped into the horizon ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE I AND OTHERS HAVE REPEATIDLY SEE “UGOs!  What now gets more fascinating, is that at 10:18 I saw another UFO that looked precisely as the previous one, but it was already at or very near where the one of 7/26 was.  Whether this UFO was the same one I saw earlier, or another one of the same type, remains to be determined.  It pretty much remained stationary as I watched it for a good 5 minutes, and then it faded out like the other one, and again, just like the one of 7/26.  NOW, putting together the fact that this last one was in the same location as where I saw the 5 “slow flashes” of the 7/26 NGO, this further leads me to believe more strongly that (1) these fireballs are indeed directly associated with these mysterious glowing objects, and (2) something of significance is happening in that area, and indeed, the entire area off northern Sanibel and Captiva Islands.","Cylindrical shape craft hovered in Northeast sky for 1 minute, then moved slowly eastward for 2.4 minutes before disappearing from view",CAPTIVA,FL,FIREBALL,2013,-0.163149246,1.139931115,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,1.653772135,0,0,0.215688591,0.008129116,0,1.07565494,0,NA,SE,LIGHT RAIN

PD)) SIGHTING # 25 – August 14, - SECOND SIGHTINGS OF GLOWING ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPPED UFOS WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO OUR NINTH SIGHTING OF “FIREBALL” UFOs AND “FLASHERS” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:30 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was clear and calm, with some clouds well past the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.  Based on my previous nights sightings and knowing that I could only see the glowing, white/gold UFOs through my binoculars, I had them trained toward the NNW, just off shore of uninhabited Cayo Costa Island, when at approximately 9:50 I got really lucky and saw two of the glowing UFOs appear to “pop” out of the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps 5 or 6 miles away from me.  I estimate the miles based on the horizon being at 7 miles over water, and these objects were just inside the horizon.  I say “lucky” because I only saw them briefly, maybe 15 seconds or so, before they “turned off,” slower than a light switch, but not as long as if on a dimmer switch.  I don’t think I would have seen them from where I was without binoculars.  These two were side by side, about 2 or maybe 3 UFO lengths apart.  I’ve estimated before that the UFOs were around 100 feet long -  at least not more than 150 feet long.  About 10 minutes later I caught a brighter goldish-white light with naked eyes, but when I got my binocs on it, I saw that there were already 2 of the objects there, one right on the water, and one just above it like before.  I couldn’t tell if they “popped” out of the water or not, but I suspect that they did.  As before, the UFO on the bottom started rising up to the one above, and they looked like they were about to merge and appeared to be touching each other, when the lights went out!  Then about another 10 or 15 minutes later, while looking through my binoculars, I saw one, then two, and then three of the same colored UFOs appear to come right out of the water again!  WOW!  Two of them were fairly close together – maybe 3 or 4 lengths apart - and the third was a litter further out to sea, maybe twice as far as the first two.  I counted 7 or 8 times that various numbers of these UFOs – up to 5 at one time – appeared and the quickly disappeared, after 5 to 15 seconds.  They always appeared to be coming out of the water, and sometimes drifting maybe 3 to 5 object heights above the water before disappearing.  I say that they appeared to come out of the water because just before they became brighter, it always seemed like there was a tiny little blob of water right at the surface before the light became full strength.  Well, maybe not “full strength, because that would be really bright, but bright enough to make out a shape.  During the time I was scanning the horizon it this area, whether there were UFOs or not, I would occasionally see a single white strobe-like flash close in the area – within view of other UFOs.  I never saw more than one flash at a time within a minute or so, but they were nonetheless consistent in the area.  Here’s where it got really interesting.  The oblong lights had not come on for a good 10 minutes or so, when I saw one of the amber “fireballs” I and others have been seeing, come on, right at the same exact location where I’d been seeing the other UFOs, but not more that 400 or 500 feet above the water.  I saw this single fireball come on through my binocs as if on a “fast” dimmer,” and continued to watch in that area for another 5 minutes or so as the light dimmed on and off.  Each time it came on it stayed on around 5 or 10 seconds, went off for a minute or so, came on for 5-10 seconds, etc. for a total of 6 times.  Each time it came on it was a few degrees higher on the horizon, going straight up.  The last time it came on it was perhaps 900 feet above the horizon, about 5 miles away from me.  After the last time it came on, nothing much happened for 20 minutes or so and I went home.",fast zigzaging light  over or around a normal plane clear night over Liverpool NY,CAPTIVA,FL,OVAL,2013,NA,1.374911211,0,0.13028168,NA,0,0.0642725,1.532752429,0,0,NA,-0.357641004,0,0.267046232,0,NA,SW,SCATTERED CLOUDS
7,25,10,3 minutes,"Seventh sighting of a ""UGO"" in past 4 weeks. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of nineteen reports, submitted by the same witness, over the course of seven weeks.  The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD)) Sighting #13 – July 25, 2013 – Seventh sighting of the “UGO” I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, next to the rock jetty at Blind pass, when a friend and I saw another Unidentified Glowing Object.  I was looking just east of due south through my binoculars when at 10:08 p.m., I spotted a dim, unmistakable white glow that appeared to be very close to Clam Bayou, just west of my friend “Carol’s” house, where we had four previous sightings of UGOs.  On one of those occasions at her house, we saw three UFO’s in association with the two UGOs, in addition to an apparently landed UFO (see “Sighting # 8 in my previously filed “Summary of 10 UFO….”).  This time both my friend and I were prepared – she at her house, and me 1.5 miles to the north (as the crow flies), looking from a different vantage point.  I had called her about 10 minutes before this sighting to tell her I was in position; this time I brought a chair to sit in for a one-hour one watch.  She was prepared to periodically go out to her porch to se what she could see.  I called her just as soon as I spotted the glow, she went out to her porch, and saw the glow, describing it as “intense.” I stayed on the phone with her for a few moments as she was describing to me what she was seeing.  The glow stayed at it’s highest intensity she had ever seen it for a minute, maybe just a tad longer.  Then it went out as before, as if on a dimmer switch.  After a minute or two, it came back on “quickly,” stayed on briefly, then went back out again.  Carol, being alone, became very frightened and afraid that the UFO’s would show up again,  then went inside.  She did not want to go out and look again, or even look through her sliding glass doors.  I stayed at my location scanning the area for another hour, hoping to see one or more of the previously seen UFO associated with the glow to show up, but I  observed nothing more.  One important thing I learned during this excursion was that just because I didn’t notice anything more doesn’t mean that there was not anything to see.  It was unlikely I would have anything unless the glow was at it’s greatest intensity, and I was luckily looking straight at it through my binoculars.  There is no possible way this glow could be “swamp gas” for two reasons: (1) the glow originates outside of the Bayou, just past and behind of the seaward tree line; (2) the bayou is quite open, and is not swamp like at all.  If these things are on any kind of a “schedule,” then the UFO’s should show up in 10 days or less.","Fast, silent, low flying cylinder in Blue Ridge Mtns of North Carolina",CAPTIVA,FL,LIGHT,2013,-0.163149246,1.548592151,0,0.81216488,NA,0,0.0642725,1.55292238,0,0,NA,0.739669356,0,-0.018345077,0,NA,WEST,MOSTLY CLOUDY

I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight's distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren't any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days.

They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky.

At first it looked like the three objects may have been flying due west in a straight line, but then got into what looked like a triangle shape and begin to almost rotate position while they dropped in altitude  (the top point of the triangle would drop down and one on the bottom would take its place).  The rotation seemed to be fairly slow as all three only made one full rotation.  We observed this pattern until one of the objects on the bottom of the triangle dropped out of our view and the others followed.  The objects were bright white in color.  Also to the east of our location is DIA (Denver International Airport).  At first, we thought it may be planes, but the object’s flight pattern would be almost impossible for a plane to follow, especially for a commercial plane that would be at DIA.  We also do not think it was helicopters either because the angles at which the objects rotated and then dropped would be too sharp.

I was on the east side of the complex, and instantly notice two bright white/red lights due east of my position.  The lights were low in the sky, maybe 5-10 degrees above the “horizon”.  Positioned horizontally level with each other, the lights were separated by about the distance between my hands when my arms were extended straight out from my body.  They lights themselves appeared much larger than any other stars or lights in the sky.  My guess, due to the size of the lights, would be within 1/2 mile of my position.  Neither light appeared to be in motion of any direction, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from either light source.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes, a third light exactly similar to the other two appeared due south of the original pair, maybe a mile or two away.  From my perspective, it too was stationary.  The thing that caught my attention most was the brightness and the clarity of the lights.  The light was not being “beamed” down or away from the source, nor was it “blinding” in any fashion.  It is best described as “clear and pure” white light, very warm without any pulsation visible.  All three sources emitted the same intensity of white light, which created a “4-point” star effect with two points up/down, and two points each left/right of the source.  What appeared to be emitting from behind each white light source was an equally bright and intense red light, whose points appeared to be along the axis of NW/NE/SW/SE when compared to the white points of light.  I describe the red lights as behind the white lights only from the stand point that the red light spheres appeared to be slightly larger than the white light, and the points of red only shown in between the points of white.  All three lights were much larger than any visible stars.  Also they were larger to any “aircraft” lights as they would normally be viewed.  All three lights remained constantly stationary.

Around the middle part of the airplane contrail I notice this silver, metallic/chrome/shiny looking object flying around the trail. I couldn’t really see it up close, but I did notice that the sun was reflecting off its surface and its movement was sporadic and really quick. It went back and forth. It was further back from the airplane and it looked nothing like the airplane so I definitely dismissed it as -- an airplane. It went through the trail and then flew fast upward and then disappeared.  Now, I know what airplanes look like and this wasn't an airplane! It was round -- at least it looked round maybe more like an oval is more like it. It's movement really freaked me out. I told my friend who I was talking to at the time that I had just seen something really strange (remember I was on my cell at the time).

Looking into the sky in front of me I had observed what appeared to be an unmistakable disc, a very bright shinny metallic silver, a silver unlike any I had seen before. I had thought to myself, maybe it is a very shinny old plane moving forward, however it was moving slightly to my right as if semi-hovering.  I could not take my eye’s off of it as it,  again ever so slowly shifted to the right .  I had also noticed a jet much farther distant and very  high with it’s vapor trails. I thought to myself this is definitely a disc and was watching to see if it would make any sharp movement’s, when a tree branch and than a number of buildings obstructed my view for about 5 to 10 seconds. I observed the craft itself for about 10 to 15 seconds. When that area of the sky came back into view there was a wide funnel/chimney cirrus type cloud extending vertical and angular to the left, in it’s place.  The disc was gone. I stopped at the pizza shop, got out the car and went out across the street to get a wider view.  If it was a plane it would still be in view somewhere, I thought.  Nothing in sight except for this broad funnel/chimney type cirrus cloud. I looked at my pocket watch and it was 12:30 pm Mountain Standard Time.

At about 9:40 PM (21:40) we saw 6-8 really bright lights traveling in an oval pattern in the sky.  Using our geographical reference, they looked to be above Arvada or Westminster.  They were moving quicker and more fluid like than any other aircraft I had observed.   The circling oval pattern abruptly stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds.  Now only 4 lights remained and they quickly shuffled around each other in their own unique oval shaped patterns. After about 5 seconds of this the lights reduced down to three in which they formed a triangle in the sky. The lights then began to weave in and out of each other, yet always returning back to the original triangle shape.  The sharp degree turns that these crafts would turn at was remarkable; they could flip a direct 180 degree turn at a really high velocity as if momentum was not a factor.

Dad was working on edits, but she persisted, so I put on my sandals and headed out the front door with her. There was an airplane flying over in the Northeast, so I looked up. There, at about 70 degrees up in the north north east what caught my eye were two very bright objects, brighter than Venus and larger in apparent diameter, and with a bit more of a yellow white color to them, similar in color to incandescent car headlights or aircraft landing lights. They were moving slowly, significantly more slowly than an average satellite, and flying due north about the width of my thumbnail (at arms length) apart in direct line with each other, both equal brightness and one directly behind the other following the exact same course. My first thought was that it was as bright as an Iridium Flare, but the Iridium satellites do not fly in clo! se formation, they are distributed around the planet for good satellite phone reception.  Well, what happened next pretty well cinched it.  They both dimmed down together, not at the same spot but at the same time, and then the dimmer ""satellites"" changed formation, with one moving off to the side and catching up with the other while moving from it's 6 o:clock position to it's 4 o:clock but keeping about the same relative distance.

I checked the time when I got back on the front porch and got some light on my watch and it was 9:20 PM MT Thursday, Sept. 28th, so it happened between 9:18 and 9:19 PM, observed from my front yard in Evergreen, CO. I came in and checked Heaven's Above, and there were NO Iridium satellites visible at all from this location this evening.  It is pretty early in the evening for a ""Satellite"" to go dark that high in the sky, the terminator (Earth's shadow) should still be farther east, (unless they were much lower and in the atmosphere) and they were still visible though much dimmer for another 30 seconds or so.  The only published satellites anywhere close to this time are these, and neither was in the proper direction, anywhere near high enough or bright enough.

It was a very nice day, mild (in the 40's), partly sunny, very light breeze. I just looked at the sky casually, but then I noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky. They were all looking north or northwest. I asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white. Most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were PERFECT spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look; however, I wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and I know I don't have 20/20 vision with them anymore. A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1.

A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.   As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.  I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.   I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any ""dot pattern"" messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.

10,25,19,2-3 minutes,"Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm. My room mate and I were walking from Capital Hill to the Starz Theatre, next to the Denver Pepsi Center to see an advance screening of ""Lions for Lambs"".  We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport. The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn't pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i've seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a ""straight"" pattern, never escalating its height. Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I'd say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714""ft. And this object was definitely within that range.. The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing.

2,26,20,20 seconds,"Witnessed V shaped lights moving without sound over Denver, Colorado for 20 seconds On Thursday, February 26, 2009, at approximately 8:40pm my mother and I witnessed some strange lights over Denver, Colorado.   Her home is located in the central Denver area in the 80204 zip code.   As we were preparing to enter her home, she mentioned that the stronger than normal winds that the Denver metro area experienced had cleared the pollution and made the stars appear brighter.   As she mentioned the clearer night sky, we looked up, initially to the south.   As we looked up, a brighter light caught our attention approaching from the southeast moving towards the northwest.   The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane. It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.  Also, the lights were moving below the clouds in the sky as the clouds did not impede the lights as they moved across the sky.  The lights continued to move towards the northwest until they were no longer visible leaving no sound.","Check out that helicopter, that ain't no chopper.",DENVER,CO,LIGHT,2009,-0.96314386,-1.414200357,0,NA,-0.136475017,0,4.262556049,-1.472570284,0,0,NA,0.739669356,0,-0.493997258,0,NA,SE,PARTLY CLOUDY

8,21,18,1-2 minutes,"Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes. I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered. I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at. I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn't pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area. The Object's distance from the ground couldn't have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance. The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day. I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind. Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path; to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag. I'm not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.",Brightly glowing sphere slowly hovered over Bellingham then ascended upwards into space.,DENVER,CO,DISK,2008,-1.802482473,1.446426892,0,NA,NA,0,16.87482696,-0.262373218,0,0,NA,1.649151817,0,-2.111214674,0,NA,SSE,CLEAR

It was black and blended into sky, and had white lights or dots on it but they weren't very bright.  It silently and slowly went right over the house.  It seemed like it was very close.

I am too freaked out to tell anyone else, especially since no one would believe me.  I was out smoking a cigarette on my patio when I saw it.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed, but a group of people in the grocery store parking lot across the street from my apartment started honking their horns at one another.  I saw them get out of their cars and point up at the sky.  DIA airport faces in the same direction, so always see when planes when they are coming and landing… but this was most definitely no plane.  I saw a light that would have looked like a twinkling star, except for a triangular shaped bright-aura surrounding it.  It was hovering above ground a couple hundred feet for a few seconds, and then shot up higher into the sky faster than any aircraft I’ve ever seen. Then it slowed down, did a zigzag up higher while going north, then disappeared.  I went inside immediately and sat down, a little disturbed by what I saw to make sense of anything.  I went back outside after a few minutes to see if the people who had also spotted it were still there, but they had left.

8,7,3,15 minutes,"Two Star-like UFO's Seen in Denver During the Time of  the  2012 Summer Olympics in August. I was up late and watering the grass at the small apartment complex I live in.  I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night. Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again. The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again. I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice; and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before. I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking. As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star.

On June 18th my girlfriend & I were driving South on highway 115 very close to the Fort Carson Base in Colorado Springs. We both independently spotted a metallic, triangular object which appeared to be ""hovering"" (no discernible movement or jet plumes visible)about about a 15-degree angle in the vicinity of Cheyenne Mountain, home of NORAD.  We both thought it might have been a large advertising balloon/blimp, but the object appeared to be much too high in altitude (maybe 1/4 mile high) and we could see no trace of attaching ropes or attached cables. We had a very clear view of the object as the skies were very clear that afternoon. We did not see any obvious lights and did not hear any noise. There was no obvious interference on the truck radio and cell phones were not in use.  We viewed the object for about 30 seconds and then lost sight of it when we passed some trees on the side of the road.

The footage shows a helicopter pouring chemicals onto a fire on a hillside in dense smoke, and suddenly from the lower left of the screen, a white light streaks by from the lower left of the screen diagonally to the upper right of the screen, past the helicopter, and out of the lens view.  Initially, it appears to be a single light, but later appears as 2 lights, but it's hard to tell if this is a second object, or just part of the original object. The film appears to be shot from another helicopter from a considerable distance, and the object appears to be moving too fast to be a bird, and since it is partially obscured by smoke as it emerges, it seems too far away to be a bug or dust.

7,15,21,15-20 minutes,"Formation of moving lights moving East to West across nearly the entire night sky At approximately 9:05 PM, I was sitting in my backyard with my girl friend, relaxing after dinner.  The 3/4 moon was shining in the Southern sky, observable through the willow tree branches in the yard.  I looked up at the moon and was surprised to see what appeared to be the Big Dipper at first, just to the East of the moon.  I was surprised to see a constellation that close to the moon, because the brightness usually obscures stars.   As I watched, I could see that there were not just 4-6 lights, but many more, and then I noticed the entire array moving from East to West.  We moved to a position where we could see more of the sky, and these lights were in a ""V"" formation, with the point of the v heading West in the direction of travel.   After about 7-8 minutes, they moved out of the line of sight, and we went to the front yard where there are no trees to obstruct the sky, and saw an array of moving lights from the Southern horizon almost to the Northern horizon.  I would describe the formation as a series of those V's I described, in linear format running North to South almost like the serrated edge of a saw blade.  The sky became misty with clouds and after a total viewing time of about 20 minutes, we could no longer see these lights.

They were very near the Moon, which was at an angle of about 30 degrees in the Southern sky.   These lights moved very slowly East to West, and maintained position in relation to one another while moving.

4,27,14,60 Seconds,"A young man in Colorado witnesses three objects interacting in sky, performing impossible maneuvers. Tuesday, April 27th, 2010 should be noted as a particularly fair-weathered, cloud-free day.  At the time of this incident there were no clouds visible, the sun was at my back, and no known aircraft could be seen or heard at this specific time.  Living relatively close to an airport, I’m very familiar with the daily sights and sounds of small aircraft and helicopters.  I was sunbathing this afternoon while on the telephone with my sister when a flash of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  The flash of light was relative to sunlight reflected by a mirror from a distance.  When I focused my attention toward the eastern sky I had a difficult time identifying exactly what I was witnessing at that moment.  I saw three spherical/disk-like objects flying in what appeared to be a perfect equilateral triangle formation.  These three, separate objects appeared to be metallic and continued to reflect light, but appeared darker on the bottom.  Perhaps the darke! r appearance on the bottom was an effect of shade.  However, the shade theory is merely speculation.  Although the objects were indeed reflecting sunlight, they did not emit any other light whatsoever. The three, separate objects held their perfect equilateral triangle formation for approximately 30 seconds. They appeared to be fading in and out of my plain of sight flying rapidly, sharply in a direct east to west motion while maintaining the triangular formation. Each separate object appeared to be twice the size of how the planet Venus appears in the night sky. One of the objects was flying at a slightly higher elevation than the two objects below. The appearance of these three objects was specifically puzzling as they appeared as if they were out of focus, exhibiting an almost hazy appearance. I live at approximately 5,500 feet above sea level. Using the western mountain peaks as a reference I estimate that these objects were flying at altitudes between 8,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level. Their low-altitude flight level could be compared to the altitude of a south-bound, ascending plane from the nearby airport, which is within a five mile radius of my home. Despite t! heir low altitude, no sounds could be heard. If I would have held a ruler to the sky to measure their distance apart, they appeared about ¾ of an inch from each other. They were not spread throughout the sky, they were tightly grouped in the equilateral triangle formation for the first 30 seconds of this occurrence. After the first 30 seconds had passed I moved toward the eastern side of my deck for a prolonged view as the objects were slowly creeping north. Suddenly these three objects began flying in circles around each other. The circular patterns they flew around each other were perfect circles which could be compared to the circular motions demonstrated by braiding three sections of hair. Weaving in a very calculated manner from left to right, up and down. They repeated this pattern 2-3 times in a matter of 10 seconds. The three objects then altered their path, all three of them were flying in completely random circles around each other similar to how flies would buzz around each other. During both patterns of circular, weaving motions the three objects became so close to each other it was difficult to discern one from the other at times. This confirmed that what I was witnessing was indeed not a small aircraft or a helicopter. I am aware of the kinds of maneuvers our known aircraf! ts are capable of and these three separate objects were not demonstrating ordinary or technical maneuvers, these maneuvers were absolutely mind-boggling. The objects maintained their relative position in the eastern sky, slowly making their way toward the north while holding their altitude. Believing the objects would hold their position I bolted inside the sliding glass door of my bedroom and swiftly grabbed my digital camera. With the objects still within sight it was obvious they had returned to their original equilateral formation in those few seconds, exactly as it was earlier; fading in and out of my plain of sight. While fumbling with my camera to set it to video mode, the objects had moved far enough to the north and east that they were no longer visible. Minutes later the sounds of small aircraft could be heard once again, and were beginning to come within sight. I later contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who referred me to the National UFO reporting center per section 6 of FAA regulations regarding Safety, Accident, and Hazard Reports, 7-6-4. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Reports. What were these three objects? Why three patters? Why a triangle? How did these objects manage these impossible maneuvers? Why the middle of the day? Why Colorado?  My sighting today has left me with many understandable, unanswered questions. The most poignant of all these questions is: When will I experience a second sighting?? Until then I will keep my eyes on the skies whenever possible.","Bright stationary light seen above Grand Marais, then tracks slowly until it disappears. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??

On July 26th, 2015, at approximately 18:30, my family witnessed an object in the sky which somewhat resembled a Ferris wheel.  The object was at a distance too high to see the dimensions, but the on and off brilliance was what first caught the eye of my oldest son who is 15.  I told him to keep his eye on the object while I ran to get my binoculars. Upon returning the object had moved very little, but was headed in a westerly direction towards the mountains.  Once I focused in on the object with my binoculars, it was a little difficult to stay steady with it because of the distance factor, however, I did have a few moments I could see the object clearly. The object appeared to be the shape of a disk and looked like a Ferris wheel because of the light pattern displayed with one bright light in the center with straight lines of light going to the perimeter of the object.  At the end of the straight lines of light on the perimeter, there were other points of light. The object was in a very slow tumble which varied from moment to moment.

7,1,16,60 minutes,"Bright object over Aurora that changed shapes as it left. We were sitting outside late afternoon and noticed a stationary light at high altitude.  It appeared to be “twinkling” and we wondered if it might be a weather balloon.  Looking at it through binoculars, we saw that it appeared to be a sphere with two smaller spheres that were either rotating around it, or the object itself was revolving, as the central sphere would shine a very bright light which would then disappear, only to reappear within a second or two.  We had a difficult time at first determining its shape because of the brightness of this light that appeared and disappeared. The light, which we at first thought might be just reflection, was very strong, and seemed to have a “diffraction” effect around the edges, which were blurry and rainbow colored.  We decided that it was no reflection, but that the sphere was actually emanating the light. After about 15 minutes, the object drifted north, and we followed its path, still observing through binoculars.  The drift made us decide it might be a balloon after all, but we kept watching because it was so unusual.  After about 10 minutes, it drifted south again, to return to its original spot.  This of course sharpened our focus, as its movements were now not simple “drifting,” but purposeful.   Then, suddenly, it started to head west, which would bring it almost overhead. It accelerated slowly at first, and as we watched we noticed that its form seemed to shift.  Overhead, we could see that the material it was made of was extremely shiny, almost like glass, and highly reflective.   The object was flying in a straight line but it “rocked” and “pitched” a little, so that the light emanating from it plus the reflectivity made it difficult to determine what was happening, as it seemed to be changing shape, elongating, and splitting into a boomerange shape, but with a middle sectio! n that was slightly smaller than the two edges.   Within a few seconds it lost all luminosity and became a dull dark grey triangle with what looked like 5 darker circles, one at each apex and two between those at the top and bottom.   It flew perpendicular to the earth so we could see the shape clearly, and rapidly disappeared in the distance. After about twenty minutes, we looked in the same direction we had originally seen it, and it was back in the same spot, but this time at a much higher altitude.  It stayed in that spot for about ten minutes, looking like the sphere with the light and the two smaller spheres rotating around it, then it changed to the dark grey triangle again.  Suddenly what looked like a puff of “vapor” emerged from it and the triangle shaped shrank rapidly and disappeared.","Bright white boomerang shaped object over Marysville, WA",AURORA,CO,CHANGING,2017,-0.805767871,1.59967478,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-0.827131849,0,0,NA,0.186071337,0,-2.539301637,0,NA,ESE,PARTLY CLOUDY

On the night of the 25th of January, 2007, I walked out to my truck and noticed two balls of light in the sky ""chasing"" each other.  I didn't think much of it at first, I figured it was probably some type of spotlight.  I got in my truck and turned on the radio, and there was incredible interference, registering +50 db on my meter.   I got out of the truck to check the antenna connection and noticed the balls had come much closer, and had become much brighter.   I watched these lights chase each other for at least 30 seconds, until they both sped toward the horizon at an unimaginable rate of speed.   I got back in my truck and the interference was gone, and I could hear several stations on the air.  I asked one of them, a friend of mine, how long he had been on the air; he told me he had been talking on that channel since 13:00.

10,15,16,22 minutes,"Spherical metallic object seen in broad daylight above University Hospital. 16:00 – I’m a cancer researcher at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Aurora, Colorado.   I left the research complex a bit early today and began walking to my car.  When I reached my car, I opened the door to get in, and I momentarily turned back toward the research buildings.  I saw a large object in the sky, and a quick comparison allowed me to estimate its altitude to be three times as high as the research building.  This was, of course, without knowing the ultimate size of the object, or the distance at which it appeared, so altitude was merely estimated.  My first thought was a helicopter, being on the campus of a university hospital, but there was no sound - absolutely no sound.  This caused me to look closer.  The object appeared to be quite large, larger than a helicopter, and spherical in shape.  Metallic silver best describes the color, with flashes of reddish-silver as the object caught the bright sunlight.  The object appeared to be hovering, slightly bobbing back, forth, up and down, as if it was a gigantic weightless balloon, tethered to the ground, accosted by the wind.  But the movements seemed different – as if they were defying gravity.  Up, then sideways, then quickly backward.  I’ve never seen any aircraft move that way.  Then, suddenly, the object shot upward and was nearly out of view within a few seconds.  I could still see the shining sunlight reflecting off of the object at its new altitude.  Suddenly, I was able to see a smaller, white object orbiting the object, which eventually shot off into the distance.  The object then ascended to an even higher altitude.  I sat down in my car, and rapidly opened my window.  The object was still visible.  I pulled out my phone and called my mother.  As she answered, I told her that I was seeing my first U.F.O. – and being a scientist, I wanted to rule out natural phenomena.  I mentioned the helicopter idea, but we both shot that down.  I mentioned an airplane – not likely.  A balloon?  It rose too quickly.  We couldn’t figure it out.  Then, as if on cue, a helicopter appeared from behind the hospital.  It passed through the general area where I had originally seen the unidentified object.  This was clearly a helicopter, it was smaller than the object, I could see the red and white paint, and I could make out the unmistakable sounds of the rotors.  It was a perfect controlled comparison.  Next, I was able to see a passenger airplane pass in the distance.  The shape, size, and sound were unmistakable.  Another perfect controlled comparison.  The object was still visible, a mere pinprick of bright light, moving slowly back and forth in the high atmosphere, reflecting sunlight every few seconds.  Suddenly, the object faded from view.  A few seconds later, I viewed a jet approaching the area where the object had been.  I could easily see the wings and shape of the aircraft, although I couldn’t make out the exact type.  The jet proceeded on its course then it disappeared on the horizon.  I waited a few more minutes, and the object appeared again.  Only for a few seconds, it quickly enlarged in size and then shrank off into the distance and disappeared for good.  It was 16:22 when I last saw the object.  I have no explanation for the events of this afternoon, although I can definitely say that the object was not a conventional aircraft.

As the craft came closer these craft were of triangle shape and all were of equal distance,  but then converged into a triangular formation. The amber was at it's highest point in the triangle formation, and as the objects traveled through the sky, the formation changed to a single file formation and then back to a triangle formation with the amber object now at the bottom of the formation. There was no sound from these craft and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  The speed was enormous for the distance I observed.

As we were paying a visit to wish grandma a Happy Thanksgiving, we happen to notice a light that was not a regular part of the hillside.  It was seeming to float above the towers up on Lookout Mt. in Golden.   We watched the light,which was a orange amber colored oval shape light, dancing above the towers.  It moved and got lower to the horizon and shifted to the right.  And began to station itself above the third tower.   This was not the only thing this orb did, it grew and shrank in size, and would turn off like a light.  And reappear again.  It would vanish and reappear in the same spot.  After viewing it 20 minutes, it was gone! Like it just vanished in thin air!  I also went home, and got on the bike to see if I could investigate further.  I brought my highest viewing binos with me.  And to no avail, was not able to find the light that was over the towers on Lookout Mt.   I am trained and UFO investigator, since 2000.

Also, there was a few air traffic that flew above the orb, and that was when it turned off and then came back again after the plane had passed.  Which was very interesting to witness.

8,8,19,20 minutes,"My wife and I were watching the sun go down, facing west, on a cloudless evening.  I noticed a very bright, relatively spherical, light hovering in the same spot for about 5 to 8 minutes due west.  It is difficult to say exactly where it was hovering, because I have no idea how large it actually was, so perhaps somewhere between Adelanto and Lancaster.   It was not especially high in the sky, appearing just over the view of the homes across the street from us, no higher than an average helicopter height, but it did not move at all like a helicopter, nor did it have any sound.  If it had been a helicopter it would have been closer to where we sat based on the perspective of its position and relative size to the homes and we would have heard a sound, seen its lights and the manner that it moved.   It began to slowly change directions and altitude getting higher and heading north. As it did, the light extended out looking more like a rocket's contrail; however you could faintly see a dark elongated shape in front of the contrail.  It did not accelerate quickly or move in an exaggerated way, rather it steadily gained altitude, steadily moved in a north-easterly direction, and the contrail continued to elongate and stayed quite bright almost white.  In other words although it resembled a rocket's contrail it never had a fiery look.  As it reached a zenith height of what I estimate to be approximately 10 to 15 miles its contrail began to fade until it simply faded out and vanished.  There were no clouds to obscure it, no darkness to cover it, it simply disappeared, but slowly as if it were erased bit by bit.   I know of no known rocket that can hover and then proceed to leave the atmosphere at such a relatively slow controlled pace, let alone disappear or fade out.","Blue, green red pulsating light in the NE sky above lafayette airport for 2 hours, then disappeared.

A second formation of 4 lights followed the first. After the formations disappeared 3 more lights in succession appeared and disappeared. Except for the reformation described above all lights behaved the same and disappeared when they reached the same part of the sky. None of us could say how fast they were traveling but it appeared to be about 2 minutes for an individual light to rise from the west and disappear (we did not think to time them).

11,4,12,1 minute,"Spherical object with bright flashing light seen moving east to west at 300-500 mph; airplane crossed path 1-5 miles behind object. While on lunch break from a local computer school, I headed to a local park to eat and call my wife. It was a bright sunny day, about 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and about 12:20 PM. I stepped outside of my SUV and was getting ready to use my cell phone, when something shiny or flashing caught my eye up in the sky. When I looked up, I saw what looked like something metallic reflecting the light of the sun – or so I initially thought – so I assumed it must be an airplane. I waited a few seconds to see the shape of the airplane come though as moved across the sky, but that didn’t happen. As I looked at it, it appeared to just be a metallic, spherical shape, but what I thought was the reflection of the sun shinning off it’s surface, turned out to be a constant flashing light emanating from what appeared to be the center area of the object. The object was traveling in an eastward to westward direction, relatively in a parallel path along the San Bernardino Mountains, but a couple of miles away from them. It also appeared to be at a somewhat lower altitude than what I’ve seen commercial passenger airliners fly at, and probably more likely at an altitude similar to what I’ve seen the smaller Cessna type airplanes at.  It was above the background view of the mountains, which means it was silhouetted against a clear cloudless blue sky. I would also guess it was traveling at a speed similar to what I’ve seen airplanes fly at, so I would guess 200-400 mph, but it would be hard for me to guess more accurately. So as I realized that it did not look like an airplane, or that the shape didn’t “change” as it flew from the east to the west to reveal any other part of the vehicle, I started to think that perhaps it actually was an Unidentified flying object – at least I couldn’t say what it was. For the entire duration of the sighing, which maybe lasted 30 seconds as it flew out of distance in the west, the shape visible to me was only a bright silvery metallic spherical one.  But the most outstanding feature of it was – upon later reflection – the bright flashing light that emanated seemingly from the center of the craft. It was very bright, as to be seen very brightly, even in the middle of this clear sunny day at noon. It flashed maybe one to one and a half times a second approximately, and it was completely constant, as you would expect to see from the lights on an airplane for instance. In this case though, the flashing light was big and bright enough, that from my perspective, when it flashed, you could not see any of the craft through or behind the flashing light. If I were to guess, I’d say the object was maybe a mile away, and about 30-50 feet diameter, but it’s very hard to say, and I could be off by quite a bit. Also, I heard no noise coming from the object, but I was not close enough to hear anything unless it had been very loud. As the object was disappearing in the distance, maybe 5 miles away to the west over perhaps the neighboring town of Clairmont or perhaps already La Verne, I could still see the flashing very bright, even though the object itself was hardly even visible any more. As it disappeared completely, the flashing was still visible, though just faintly now, and then that too disappeared in the distance. The whole time the vehicle did not seem to slow down or accelerate, or deviate off of a perfectly straight course. What really put it in perspective, as to the fact that the object was in fact about that size, altitude, and shape, is that as it was disappearing out of sight, a passenger airliner was going from a south to north direction, presumably taking off from the neighboring Ontario International Airport. The airliner was a little higher up, but the shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, even though it was farther and higher than the sphere had been when it had been closer to me. And there were no visible lights flashing from the airliner, even though I believe they keep their wing lights on, but in any case, no lights were visible in the bright sunny day, and no reflections at all were seen bouncing off of the airplane or anything like that. The shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, from the time it first came into view, until it went out of sight in a northward direction. After about 2 minutes or 3, after both the spherical object, and the airliner went out of view, another airplane crossed over to the west, going from a more or less southeast direction to a northwest one. This airplane was traveling at what I assume is standard commercial jetliner elevation, since it seemed pretty high up, but again, the shape of it as being of an airplane, was unmistakable, and no light or reflections coming from it. It was only as I put all of those things together, that afterwards I was pretty convinced that I had seen something very unique and quite possibly a UFO.  And I mean “UFO” in the truest sense, because it was truly unidentifiable to me, and it was flying.  It could be some military craft, or yes, I guess what people typically call a “UFO” – a craft from other than our time / space / or dimension.   Whatever it was, it was absolutely not a conventional airplane, or helicopter, or whether balloon, or cloud, or falling satellite.","Bright light in sky, faded and then disappeared.",UPLAND,CA,SPHERE,2010,-0.372983899,1.885737505,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-0.827131849,0,0,NA,-0.179698783,0,-2.634432073,0,NA,ESE,SCATTERED CLOUDS

Objects appeared to be fixed together about 50ft apart. Two red-orange glowing balls of light with a cloud-like glow trailing behind each 'unit' and making them appear like comet trails about 1-1/2 times in length longer than the width of the units or glowing balls. At first appearance it seemed like perhaps two closely piloted helicopters carrying glowing balls rigid to their bodies and the glow lingering in a trailing cloud or mist behind them. There was no sound from the object or possible paired objects. It flew from west to east overhead maybe two hundred feet above Interstate 80 going past Donner Lake in Truckee, toward Reno. It traveled about the same speed as freeway traffic below in a straight path coincident with the freeway. The appearance of the two glowing balls of light with glowing tails, the lack of any audible noise, the steady and straight navigation, and with no experiences in my life of seeing such object(s) in night sky in my lifetime, and the seeing such an event twice in the same month, all provoked me to research the Internet for any such similar sightings tonight or in the past.

4,11,8,15 minutes,"3 to 5 orange lights hovering in night sky and then slowly rising and moving into clouds in a cyclic pattern I was riding my bike home from tennis and stopped by Taco Bell to get something to eat at about 8.45 in the evening on April 11th 2013 in South Torrance, CA.  As I was leaving Taco Bell on my bike I noticed an orange object hovering in the sky to the south at about an angle of 45 degrees to me.  It seemed fairly close, and I would guess within a mile.  It was hovering over the hills just south of Pacific Coast Highway..  It was unusual I thought so I stopped riding my bike and began to watch it.  It stayed stationary for approximately a minute when it began to move slowly upwards into the sky which was slightly cloudy.  It got fainter as it got higher into the clouds until it was about to disappear.  During this rise I noticed a what I thought at the time was a plane flying low into view in the same general area off to the right.  As it got closer I realized it had the same coloration of the previous object.  An orange perhaps slightly red color.  it proce! eded to the same spot in the sky that the previous object had hovered and stayed there for perhaps a minute or so.  There were no blinking lights on either of these objects, just an orange color the shape of which I couldn't make out.  (I didn't have any glasses on which would have helped me to see them more clearly)  This second object too began to rise higher into the sky and about this time 2 more object flew into view to the lower right and proceed to the same spot in which the first two had hovered, and they too hovered in that spot for several minutes, both slowly moving while hovering.  These eventually disappeared also.  And I proceeded the remaining half mile to my apartments down the street.  I looked back before heading in, and saw another orange light of the same type in the same general area and watched it for about 5 minutes.  A person walked by as I was watching and asked me if I saw it too, and I said I did. I can only speculate on what I saw, but it is very intriguing and I hope to get more information on this sighting.  I at first thought it could be a hot air balloon, but then when it moved upwards into the clouds and others flew into the area I ruled this out. The other normal explanation I have thought of is that perhaps they were a group of people flying helicopters in a cyclic pattern for some unknown reason (Perhaps to simulate a UFO event).  I didn't see any red or green blinking lights in the objects, and I am not sure if I saw any white lights.  It was predominantly orange.  I do not remember hearing any noise coming from that direction, though I am not sure if I would have been close enough or not to hear any if they were helicopters.   When I got back to the hot tub at the apartment right after the sightings, I asked if any one else had seen them an one man in the hot tub said he had seen an orange object in the sky about 10 minutes earlier.

6,22,12,20 Minutes,"Los Angeles - Bright lights seen by 4 witnesses during shuttle reentry.  12-15 bright lights moved around the sky for 20 minutes. From approximately 12:30pm-1pm on Friday, June 22, two of us left lunch to try to hear the sonic boom the space shuttle was to create as it entered the atmosphere.  The shuttle was set to land at 12:49pm at Edward’s Airforce Base, northeast of our location in Torrance, California.  We trained our eyes to the north in hopes of catching a glimpse of the shuttle (however improbable that might have been).  At 12:45 we hadn’t heard the boom so we went into the restaurant and turned on CNN.  The shuttle had yet to land so we went back outside.  When we looked to the north we saw what appeared to be 3 very bright lights following a dark object.  We assumed that we were looking at escort planes following the shuttle.  For about 2 minutes the lights followed the dark object in a triangle formation.  Suddenly 3 more lights appeared.  Several seconds later 3 more lights appeared and so on.  At one point there were about 15 very bright lights in the sky.  Two other people walked over and watched in amazement as these lights moved.  Most of them were moving from north to south but some appeared to alter their course, moving east and west.  After several minutes all but 3 lights disappeared, as did the dark object.  One light stayed fixed in the same position while two others passed overhead (at what appeared to be a very high altitude).  We thought that maybe something terrible had happened to the shuttle and we were looking at pieces of debris. We rushed back inside to see that the shuttle had safely landed.  When we went back outside the lights were gone.  Possible Explanations:  1) The lights could have been shiny balloons.  However:  -Some of the lights changed direction moving west and east.  Most were moving southeast.  -It was a sunny day and these objects were very bright in the sky.  The two that passed overhead were still bright as they passed near the sun.  -Some appeared to be moving in a triangle formation.  They split apart then came back together.  -They did not appear to be rising nor losing their intensity over time.  -The lights did not flicker like balloons would as they rotate in the sky.  2) The lights could have been airplanes. However:  -They were all the same size the whole time we observed them.  Even the lights that went overhead appeared to be the same size as the ones further away.  -They did not move like airplanes.  One stayed completely stationary throughout the 10-15 minutes we watched them.  Some moved quickly, others slowly.  -Two groups of 3 appeared and disappeared in unison.  -They were not reflective like airplanes.  Other planes going to and from LAX flew by and would only reflect light for several seconds at a time.  The two strange lights that passed between us and the sun stayed illuminated the whole time.  All of them were much brighter than you would expect from normal airplane reflections.  3) It could have been debris/fuel/waste from the shuttle.  However:  -The lights did not fade over time like you would expect to see from debris burning up.  -They did not leave a trail.  -Some lights were moving quickly while the single one remained stationary.  Some also appeared to fly in formation.  There were four of us that witnessed the event.  The only rational explanation we could come up with is that they were shiny, helium filled balloons.  I’ve seen balloons in the sky before and, because of the reasons I outlined earlier, I truly don’t believe in this hypothesis.  It is also a very strange coincidence that this would have happened at the same time and place the shuttle would have been reentering the atmosphere.

During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed.

We heard no noise or saw no indication of a missile launch out of Vandenburg Air Force Base; next launch is scheduled for February 24, 2009 per Vandenburg’s calendar.  The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time.  However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its’ vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its’ shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its’ shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position.

It was observed by 3 people - a 39 yrs old guy, working in IT industry and well educated, his 8 yrs old daughter, who is in third grade and his 64 yrs old mom, who has been science teacher for most of her life. Initially, the dad thought it was a helium balloon left free by some kid, but the round object flew at a constant height and constant speed and it flew across the sky instead of going up, as in helium balloon.  We cannot recollect seeing any such object before and so we think it is an alien object.  We could not take picture because it flew off our sight in 1 minute.

It was about an hour ago and obviously 20:07 hasn't happened yet :).    The sky was clear with little clouds at the time of sighting.  We were playing in backyard, watching humming birds when we saw this object.  First I thought it was a helium balloon because it was about the same size, but its speed, height and direction didn't gel with any free flying balloon.  It was flying towards Thousand Oaks which is west of Simi Valley and I am sure others might have seen it if someone was driving in the car or outside looking towards sky.    My daughter was first to notice, then my mom, and then me.  My mother said, she observed something like fans on either side of round object, but when I looked up it was a bit far and didn't notice anything like that.    Hope this helps.

It caught my attention at approx. 3:05 am in the western sky in the lower horizon seeming to be going up heading west to north. At first I thought it was someones special effects launch like a Sky Lantern round and brightly colored reddish orange like the color of Mars in the sky but as I directed my friends attention to the object we noticed that it began to move from west to east staying consistent in color and brightness. There were no clouds a slight breeze and was very clear. As we watched it move I noticed and confirmed this with my friend that there was a faint short very fine orange mist particle trail behind it.

I was standing by the pool when someone called my attention to an odd orange light in the sky that was varying in intensity like a fire.  It was moving towards us at the right speed and altitude to be a small plane and was heading from south to north.  I then noticed my son standing next to me looking at it as well. I thought at first it was a plane on fire.  As I watched I noticed that there were no other lights on this object like an aircraft should have, just a chaotic dimming and brightening orange light.  We did not hear any sound from the object but we did have music playing outside that could have masked any sound.  We watched the object travel across the sky, behind a large pine tree, and back into view.  A few moments later it started dimming and then went out entirely and we could see only dark sky.

I was enjoying the day, seated in the patio, working with my PC.

Later upon examining all the photos in my PC, I saw the object that looks like a saucer, shiny surface and all. (This is a crop of the original, zoomed-in photo.)   Later in the afternoon, I heard another chopper, went out, and there was the same green one.  I tried again, but it was too low to focus and I had my camera in zoom to take photos of distant objects, so I could not catch it.  Again, I continued to take pictures of the sky at random.

A white object was approaching the formation from the west and below at an angle of approximately 45°.  At first I thought it might be another goose joining the formation, but I’ve never seen a “white goose” so I thought that it could be a seagull.   As I tried to get a better look at it, I couldn’t distinguish any appendages such as wings or head, it appeared to be spherical in shape with what looked like a mirror sort of reflection flashing randomly, nothing like a wing with regular features or motion.  Its size appeared to be similar to a goose or seagull. As the object started to get close to the geese, their formation became erratic and the typical “V” became chaotic while it appeared that they were trying to regroup but were unable to.  The white object reached a point close to the geese–with the direction of the flock being east and referring to the direction of flight as 12:00, the white object stayed at approximately an 8:00 position close to the group, but not inside, now moving as if it were part of the group. I was trying to adjust my vision to see the white object as a bird considering that my eyes were, “playing tricks” with my perception, but I just couldn’t see anything but a sphere.    After a minute or so, the entire flock including the white sphere “disappeared”.   There were no obstructions or clouds to block my vision, but I moved around to different positions to try to get a different perspective because at this point I wasn’t really considering something unusual happening.  What really held my attention was the thought that I was seeing some sort of albino goose.   It took a few minutes after the flock of geese disappeared that it struck me that something more unusual was going on.

The objects appeared to be reflective and seemed to move relative to each other. The formation stopped their movement when they were roughly due north from my line of sight and formed a circular cluster. Some of the objects in the middle of the cluster appeared to rotate and catch the light from the sun. It appears that the objects, because of this behavior, were faceted.

They would literally disappear and reappear as I watched.  At one point, I could see only three, and they were in a triangle formation.  Then suddenly the rest reappeared. The objects also seemed to multiply. I would be staring at one, and it appeared to split into two. The grouping seemed random, but very close together.  Almost like pockets of white dots. They were not straight up in the air, but almost straight up. If “straight up” means 90 degrees, then I would say they were at about 70 degrees. They moved, but not like airplanes.

5,4,21,12 minutes,"It was around 9:20pm last night (May 4, 2010) and it was pitch black; the sky was clear and we could see the stars, and there was some wind, it was warm.  My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you're searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it's new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights. We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent. There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn't see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around. It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing – although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape ""/"", with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order. The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn't behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into ""cloaking"" mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing. Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That's the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can't tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn't see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I've seen sheriff's dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles. We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn't drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared. We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw. The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this. Our backgrounds: My husband is in IT and I am a technology and sciences editor for a national publication. We've never seen anything out of the ordinary before and have lived here 3 years, so we also know what's common in the sky here. My husband is a firm skeptic, and I'm uncertain. I'm aware of military testing at VAFB and I have seen missile tests at a distance from the 101, and this didn't look like that. I've also seen small meteors and meteor showers and they don't hover and glide.","Black rectangle object moving East over Charlotte, NC in CLT airspace",SANTA CLARITA,CA,FORMATION,2010,-0.622162549,0.404341251,0,NA,NA,0,NA,-0.201863365,0,0,NA,-0.357641004,0,-1.159910312,0,NA,NORTH,UNKNOWN
4,8,15,20 min,"While cutting up a fallen tree at my friend’s house in the forest (highway 14/Sand Canyon Rd area) I decided to take a break and lie down on the gate of my truck and view some clouds passing through the canyon.  While observing a low cloud that was ""splitting"" and evaporating, I saw an unexplained object in the sky.  Looking up from approx a 45 deg angle from my truck, I saw a round object at a very, very high altitude.  It was by chance I saw this; it was directly right of the cloud formation I was looking at and was quite high; I doubt I would have seen while even looking up at birds.  At first I tried to reason that it was a high flying aircraft or a maybe a passing satellite.  But after a very brief arch like movement in the sky, I viewed this object in one spot for at least 20-25 minutes.   After a few minutes I grabbed my Carson binoculars out of my truck to get a better view which made a bit of a difference.  It was just motionless in the air (jumping around in my binoculars since you cant keep your hands perfectly still) and then I saw a blue, what appeared to be arrow-tipped shaped object rotate around the original round object that I was viewing.  After about 10 minutes the ""arrow"" seemed to be gone and the object seemed to emit a red and white (alternating) light. This could have been the sun/light anomaly but I was observing the lights in timed intervals.  I was looking at this for another 10 minutes.  For a third time I took the binoculars away to see where the object was in relation to the tree in front of me, but this time when I looked up I couldn’t locate it again.

They appeared to be satellite-like objects in brightness and appearance (somewhere above the mesosphere) but  were less bright than the space station.  Three things caught my attention that made me think they were extraordinary; #1- their formation #2- their speed, which was approximately 4-5 time faster than anything I’ve ever seen in space and #3- their trajectory was not straight.  As they streaked across the sky they made a slow turn to East and their formation slightly changed.  It remained a delta, but their proximity to each other loosened up slightly.

5,13,16,1 minute,"White, semi translucent orb moving in erratic directions, hovering and then leaving at immense speed. On 5/13/14 at approximately 1600 hours I observed an object in San Jose, Ca, near highway 237.  The object was a sphere or orb, white and semi translucent. The object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball.  The shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape. I first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 – 25 mph winds heading South by South East.  The object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby San Jose Airport.  Several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time. The object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 – 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 – 60 ft.  The object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that I observed.  Another way to characterize the speed, I have worked closely with F-18 Hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed. I doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen.  None of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds. There were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that I observed the object through.  I have never seen anything like it. There was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about.

While my wife was in the car she was looking at the sky and started to see a black sphere and called me to come from in front of the car and to look up,  when I looked up I see a black sphere and I'm telling my son to go and get his binoculars and when he came back he said he can't find them so he brought his sister's I-pod touch and I started to take pictures.   I then started to take video but I was having trouble seeing the sphere on the I-pod so I pointed the I-pod to were it was the last time I saw it and started to record.  We saw the black sphere for about seven to nine minutes it moved sideways, up, down, and would also stay in place for a minute and take off.  After it disappeared we heard in the back round military jets going to were the black sphere were. I came inside my house and started to see the pictures and the videos put the screen was to small to see anything so I downloaded it to my computer and started to darken the color of the pictures to see it better and I started to see white spheres on the pictures so I started to see the videos that I took and the same thing the white spheres were there too.  Then I converted the three minute video to one hour and twenty minutes and also adjusted the lighting and when I played it back it shocked me and scared me because the white spheres where going in and out of the clouds and some even left a trail when they came out from the clouds.    they are different sizes and they are more than thirty or forty spheres and they move so fast and if you go frame by frame you can see them going in and out and some stop and you can see that they are white round spheres.

We were at San Quentin village on the little beach. I looked up into perfectly clear blue sky and happened to see 3, very small points of brilliant white light. The lower 2 seemed to be one over the other and the top light was equidistant from the other 2, but to the left, about 15 degrees. The 3 lights were ""joined"" by 2 very thin, black lines. I asked my brother if he saw anything up in the sky, without showing him and he described what I saw. I then went over to my 21 y/o niece, and without describing to her what I saw, asked her. She described the same  lights. The 3 lights were due south of San Quentin Prison, and possibly directly high over San Francisco. It wasn't possible to estimate the distance - but they were, as best I could tell (I triangulated with a tree branch) motionless over the city (or at least in that direction). There was an air show down in South Bay that day and 2 military jets did do a low pass over us before we saw the 3 lights. We saw the 3 lights for 30 to 45 minutes and then as my brother and I were watching, they ""seemed"" to flit up and disappear. They left no vapor trails Their light was almost lazer-like, dazzling and just a pinpoint with some slight ""flaring"". I am also a pilot and can state that it wasn't a satellite, a plane, a balloon or blimp. About a year later, I ran into my sister-in-law's brother - and - he recounted that he, from the South Bay, was working on his house on the weekend and also had seen a series of, what he proceeded to describe, as the same type of lights and about the same time of the year.

The sky was bright blue, with strong, gusty winds blowing from the northeast. I paused on a bluff that overlooks the Santa Ana riverbed to look at the scenery. I noticed a bright object in the sky to the west. I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity. After watching it hover, the size gradually reduced to where it looked like a star visible in the daytime. After watching the object for almost a half an hour, I started to walk home, stopping every so often to see if the object was still there. I hoped to locate it once I got home, where I could use binoculars to look at it, however the road took a turn through tall trees, and I was unable to find it again. It continued the flashing effect for the entire duration. There were numerous jet and propeller driven aircraft seen in the sky during the time of the sighting.

At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds.

The witnesses started stargazing and discussed the various constellations observed in the night sky. Witness 1 saw the craft reappear in the eastern sky, about 45 degrees or close to the horizon,  while stargazing and two two of the witnesses saw what it looked like. The third witness was on his cell phone and missed this. The craft was then golden metallic and triangular in shape. Kept moving normally, moving in a straight line, then disappeared again ! during pass two. The craft disappeared in the center of the sky during its second pass by the witnesses. Shortly after this they observed something twinkle over the El Paso Mountains. Then the object disappeared again. Shortly after this the witness heard a high pitched whistling type hum after the craft left the area in a south to southeast direction.

The center light was off. Left side back light on. The center light was off. Cycled through in a regular pattern while crossing the sky. The craft flew close to the horizon during most of the sighting(s).  Lights:  Cycling lights were seen through the whole observation. Craft color:  Craft structure looked metallic but color was not discernible. The craft was dark in color (couldn't describe color) with white lights that  were solid. The actual lights did not strobe but they exhibited a pattern of cycling light formations. The craft color did become ""orangish"" with white lights when it broke into three vertical 90 degree triangles. Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound:  Mixed howl or a ""like wind blowing through a mine"" and the sound kept moving with the craft.  Experience details:  Arrived at the trail head of the college, past the BLM sign giving the trail name, and parked in a dirt area. College was directly to the north of the witnesses.  Got out of the car and Witness 2 looked to the east and saw three lights. The two lights disappeared which caught the witnesse's interest. The lights were observed on the horizon. The lights stuck close to the horizon throughout the flight. Two of the witnesses were talking while Witness 2 observed the object fly east when the object was seen again. The craft turned south and moved in a southeasterly direction skirting the horizon. It was low to the mountain tops.  When the object was directly south of the three witnesses, Witness 2 saw the object lights ""jump back"" before continuing in a southeasterly direction towards Trona.  The object flew east before disappearing behind an easterly mountain range. Before disappearing over the eastern mountain range the object broke vertically into three triangular shaped objects which flew separately in formation.

It was very bright and steady. I turned around only to find a brighter star/planet on the horizon where the sun had just set. When I turned back around, there was a second star even farther east of the star that was near the moon!  It too was bright. I started my scan around the heavens to see what was appearing and by the time I got back to the bright star/planet east of the moon, I noticed something very odd. The star/planet to the left of the one that was near the moon was now GONE. One minute it was there and the next minute it was gone.

The light was also heading north bound. My husband made a u-turn to park in an empty parking lot across the street to get a good look. When we parked, we were surprised to see the the light had also changed direction and was in the sky in front of us. The light became very bright and blurry. No matter how much we stared at it, neither of us could focus on it. It danced in the sky from side to side in an unsual pattern. I noticed three men across the street outside a coffee shop. They were also looking up at this strange object. It was a big ball of fire. The way it moved in the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen. Afer five minutes tiny balls of fire dropped from the huge ball of fire. When this happened, I got scared. I didn't know what was falling. I even told my husband to get back in the car. Several of these smaller balls of fire fell from the large one. As the objects fell, the original fire ball shrank in size until it was gone. Once it was gone, I looked back over to the men that were across the street looking up at it. I told my husband that we should drive up to them and ask them if they could make sense of what we had just seen. Unfortunately, they got in there car and left before we could get to them. Once again, this ball of fire dancing around in the sky was unlike anything I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I stopped at the corner of Esplanade and Topaz Street to look up and see the vehicle perform maneuvers for about 10 minutes.

For about 15 seconds it then drifted again east traveling up in a higher elevation By this time I pulled over and someone else behind me pulled over and we got out of our cars at the same time. We both were trying to figure out what it was. The most acurate part to what  we both saw was that there was about three planes coming in different directions coming towards each other so comparing the way it moved and looked was very much different compared to the planes we were looking at in the sky. The planes in the sky had blinking lights like every plane does at night and this craft did not.  The craft then again moved straight up in elevation then  stayed in its position for another 30 seconds and disappeared in the direction of space.

7,4,23,1 minute,"Lighted craft hovers over Shasta Bally Mountain electronics At 11:47 PM July 4, 2013, Redding, CA - I was sitting outside facing the west where I have a clear view of Shasta Bally (approx. 11 miles due west as the crow flies)- a mountain between Redding and the west coast.  It has quite a bit of electronics on the summit - TV and radio  transmitting towers, microwave repeaters, etc. I noticed a ‘star’ start to drop straight out of the sky straight down on top of Shasta Bally.   As it came closer to Shasta Bally is got bigger and brighter then is stopped and hovered over the mountain - it was about the size of a silver dollar sitting over the mountain and it was an extremely bright white light illuminating the mountain. It hovered there approx. 30 seconds and then moved to the right then back where it had been and then back (to the west) dropping down behind the mountain (which really illuminated the mountain even more) before it shot up and out of sight leaving a tracer line as it disappeared into the sky. This is not the first sighting there have been at least 6 in the past 5 months with 2 ( 2-3 weeks ago) in one night.  One was a bright white light and the other was a bright red light.  I saw them within 10 minutes of each other.  Before the sighting on July 4th they only hovered for a few seconds before darting off leaving a tracer line and disappearing into the sky.  Their  hovering size was not as large and bright as the one on the 4th. I saw another on Friday night 7/5/13 which acted like the others - didn’t stay very long before leaving. I go outside to smoke several times at night so what are the odds - I’ve seen so many?   The number of visitations per night must be astronomical.

9,15,13,5 minutes,"Three persons see bright lights flying over Redding, California. My son came into my room and told me to get out of bed and come look at the light in the sky. At which time I did. As we was walking he started telling me to hury before I missed it. After going out the front door he had me follow him up to the street in front of are drive way which faces the north were we met up with his friend. At this time they directed me to look up and in a southern direction. It was summer time and quite clear outside lots of stars shining. There in the sky looking like a star to fare away to see any structure was a flying object very much looking like a star but much brighter. While it was flying you could clearly see the stars disappear beyond it.  But it was very high much higher then local aircraft fly.this flying object was flying in a darting back and forth manner or away and closer in a small tight area and at times would just stay still. at the end of the sighting the object at such a fantastic speed it went up in a direction towards the stars to the point which it disappeared. I my self am not a pilot.  I will say I have studied aircraft most my life and I know that the government has aircraft many years ahead of what we get to see. I know of no such aircraff that can fly in that maner also I know of no way a pilot could with stand that kinds of force and survive or how any aircraft could even stay together. The way this lighted object moved looked to be controled and very very fast. I know of no air craft that can exel to such a high speed and without stoping or turning suddenly change direction back to the direction from which it was going.  I never seen a structure and at any time nor did any sound come from the object.

I was in the pool at a condo complex in Rancho Mirage, CA, with my 10-year-old daughter and her friend.  It was mid morning and the sky was very clear, no clouds.  I looked up to the Northeast, near the San Jacinto mountains, and saw what I first thought was a very large flock of birds flying in formation.  I called my daughter and her friend over to watch because it was so unusual. When I saw an airplane fly under this flock, I realized these objects were too high to be birds. They were also far too synchronized.  It was the most bizarre sight I have ever witnessed. I’d say there were at least two dozen of these shiny bird shaped objects.  They would fly briefly to the right, then turn and go to the left, then divide in a mosaic type of pattern.  I commented to the girls that it was like watching a kaleidoscope. They repeated this pattern this for at least five minutes as we stood there, frozen, watching and trying to figure out what exactly we were seeing.  The girls thought balloons, no too shiny and too synchronized.  I thought sky divers, but that would have been quite a show and far too high.  I tried to figure if something was being projected onto the sky, but how could that happen in broad daylight?    After this pattern repeated at least three or four times, they flew southward in a V formation like this:  >  They flew in a southwest direction until they disappeared toward the mountain range.   My daughter actually said, ""Maybe we are imagining this.""   I told her that three people don’t imagine things at the same time. I’m still amazed by what we saw.  My aunt died yesterday and I honestly thought she was sending some sort of message.  But it’s not much of a message if I didn’t understand it.

10,2,15,14 minutes,"From front yard of my house, it was perfectly clear skies when I looked straight up and saw a white dot that I almost looked away and dismissed it as mid day star.  But then I noticed it was moving in a Northwest direction.  A few months ago I watched the space station move across the sky at night over southern california.  It resembled that to me as in the size and speed at which it moved.  But then I noticed once it got from directly overhead to a slight northwestern direction it seemed to stop and then move in a flat eastern direction slowly for about 2 minutes.  If I had to judge distance the movement from the beginning would have been 3 feet in line of sight from southeast to northwest then about 9 inches in line of sight eastern direction before continuing northwest out of my site behind a obstructing tree.  I saw several plans flying at high altitude flying near or directly underneath this object and it was obviously way higher than them. Like I said it looked like a mid day star but moving. When it was directly over my head at the beginning of my sighting it seemed to shimmer as if it was reflective.  Which in turn would kind of make it look larger and smaller.  The last I saw of it, it was getting fainter but as if something that moves away gets smaller.  I have always been into ufo sightings but never had what I felt to be a genuine sighting.

7,8,2,2 Hours,"Three objects and static shock in Pine Valley and three witnesses I was camping with two friends out in Pine Valley, CA, roughly 50 minutes east of San Diego in a forest/desert area on top of a mountain. We had been sitting around the fire talking, having a few s'mores, listening to 91x rock radio.  The first thing we noticed was a very bright, flashing sphere of light.  Red, blue, and green lights, and it looked like the blue lights strobed around the middle circumfrence of the ball, flashing twice per second.  Didn't think much of it until it started getting closer.  We turned up the music and began flashing the truck headlights and it grew twice as large and even closer.  At this time we were freaking out and shut off the headlights and turned off the music.  Whatever is was hovered erratically for thirty seconds and dissappeared instantaneously.  We couldn't believe what had just happened and sat back down by the fire and were talking about it when the strangest thing that has ever happened in my life hit all three of us at once.  We were in a half circle, sitting on the ground, and from the tips of my fingers spreading through my whole body I recieved a powerful jolt of electricity, a quick ZAP!  It wouldn't have been a huge deal, but ALL THREE OF US GOT HIT EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME!  The millisecond it happened we all looked directly into each other's eyes and said, ""Holy $%#@, DID YOU FEEL THAT!  All three of us had recieved a shock the strength of an electric fence, at the exact same time, but instead of my whole body being shocked at once, i first felt the jolt in the tips of my fingers because I was pointing at something and it was the closest body part to the dark forest in front of us.  The crazy thing was, I thought I heard a faint zap type of a sound when it happened, and it seemed to have come from the forest, directly below where we had seen the spherical object with flashing lights.  The night had just begun.  The music and truck lights were turned back on, when two of us noticed something and called over the third person.  We saw a creamy-white light, larger than a star, but we couldn't tell if it was in our atmosphere, or out in the solor system.  It seemed far away and close at the same time.  It was moving in a swooping direction, like how you would draw a puffy cloud, or in elementary school when you move the decimal point you make the swoosh under the numbers to count how many spaces to move the decimal.  That is the movement this object was making, yet totally different location in the sky, different color, and complete different erratic movement than the first object we saw.  Immediatley following, there was one more oject that appeared way, way out, as far as the stars and about the size of a star, but it was going up, down, left, right, diagonal, every direction possible.  It was so erratic it was completely unpredictable where it would move next.  All three sightings lasted nearly five minutes each, spread out over the course of almost three hours.  That night was the clearest I have ever seen the sky, even more clear than it is in the middle of Alaska.  There were aircraft going by, easily distinguished by there red and green lights, direction, altitude and speed.  I am a pilot so I know what is an airplane and what is not,and what we saw that night, had no scientific, logical, or spiritual explanation.  We all told each other we are surely not alone in this universe.  And we proved it to ourselves that night.  Even though all three of us saw those objects, the craziest, most insane thing that has every happened to any of us was being shocked, jolted, in the middle of the dark forest, with no person, place, or thing around.  It was absolutely insane, and will remember that night for the rest of my life.

I have seen one up close up, in march so I now know without a doubt they are here. As I wavered in the wind, for I am where windmills are. the wind gusts were up to 35mph blowing at their usual direction, from west to east in the palm springs-morongo valley wind pass.  It was an Exceptionally windy night. As I had almost decided I needed to get out of the wind, one of the stars I had been looking at, Seemed to flash.  Lately I am used to this too because so many plantes are around and making Strange flashes that show all colors of rainbows the more I look.   I noticed this star was not in the Night sky the night before, because as it was my birthday, I had made a point to go out and notice Where the stars were because they are in the same position as the day I was born.  This star Was not there.  As I looked to my right, I noticed a lot of planes really high up, then a plane Caught my eye back to the left, which Is over the southeastern portion of hwy 111 off the Hwy 10.  It is virtually desolate and one goes many miles through the middle of the desert To get to palm springs.  The plane seemed to be flashing really bright when I realized it Was the star. It looked like it had actually turned on. The plane looked like it was going to go right into this star, when I realized it was so high up that the plane was just a tiny dot in proportion to the immese size of this perfectly round looking planet/star.  Immediately, my mind knew it was Just another planet making the wild color show, when low and behold, it flashed bright red! Like a flashlight in the sky! The whole planet,star lit up!

As I looked  back to the planet/star, an ifo craft had shot out of it and flew straight up and then over to The east, in it’s curvy straight way until it disappeared from being so high and going so fast straight to the east. And then I looked at the planet/star and it had started moving to it’s northwest at the moment The craft launched. The wind was gusting from west to east.  It then moved very very slowly northwest then went straight west, into the horizon.  I had time to go get my camera but was too excited to get it to work.

There was clearly some kind of field or energy emanating from the object, my best description being an electric smoky haze.  What it did:   	At first I thought it was a planet, until my girlfriend and I confirmed to each other that it was darting in random directions (few hundred feet?) within the area in the sky it was spotted. Each time it darted we would correctly confirm the direction to each other. It would also pause and very slightly contract and expand (this would excite the very slight field/haze surrounding it)  Shape and Color:  	Craft: 	- Yellow 	- Star shaped (a small bright light) 	- No twinkling  	Being: 	- Translucent 	- Appeared like a cephalopod. Single source of bluish-white light in the “head” region.  A being captured on video:  	I turned on my iPhone 4 to try to attempt to capture this object in the sky. The phone defaulted to the rear-facing self-portrait (facing behind us). Before switching it to the forward camera, I noticed something coming in to view from behind a retaining wall. It was a translucent, floating being. I turned my head to see the creature behind me, but there was nothing visible.  Turning back to the camera, the creature remained on screen.  I held the camera on the creature until its body language displayed that it noticed us watching it via the camera.  The creature then swiftly vanished upwardly.

Sunday November 24, 2013, 18:28 (6:28PM)   At 18:28, the witness walks outside into the parking lot of the witnesses work on a routine walk when the witness sees a bright bluish white light above the San Gabriel Mountains that draws the witness attention.  The light is brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest and bigger in diameter.   The light object begins to dim then three other lights to the left of it appeared.  They were small and dim.  A total of four lights all together.   From left to right the colors are a dim white, a dim red, a dim orange and a dim white(the brightest light) that.  A few seconds later the farthest light became bright again as before.   The other lights were not noticeable when the bright light would be at its brightest.  Then it would dim and then get bright again for about three more times.   Then at around 18:31 the far right brightest light dimmed down and was in sync with the other lights.  All the lights begun to flash two to three times then all lights went dark.  The witness waited five minutes and the lights did not reappear.  The witness goes back inside the witnesses work.  Five minutes later the witness goes outside again to check if the lights were anywhere but could not be seen. The city the where the witness viewed the light object from is Monrovia, CA.  The area where the Light Objects or Light Spheres was seen is in the San Gabriel Mountains in the area four to eight miles north of Azusa, CA.  The heading from Monrovia would be North-North East.   From the witness point of view, the object was well above the top of the mountains.  The time frame when the Light Objects seen is 18:28 to 18:31.  The Light Objects or Light Spheres were in a straight line from the left to the right (NNW to SSE) as seen from the witness point of view.  There were a total of four lights seen including the brightest light.   The Brightest light color was a bluish to white light in the color temperature of 5500 to 6500 Kelvin.  The diameter of the bright Light Object was about 40-50% bigger than the planet Venus on the same night seen from the ground to the sky.   The Light Objects or Light Spheres seem to have never moved from its position.  The witness stepped outside from the b! uilding the witness was in and the Light Objects or Light Spheres were already in position and did not seem to move only disappear after the event happened.  No noise was heard possibly due because of the distance from object and witness.   The witness was alone at the time of the event.  Pictures were taken but due to lighting conditions and the technology there are inconclusive.   Conclusion is that the Light Objects or Light Spheres are unidentified.  The lights seemed to be together as one craft but the lights could be separate from each other.  There could be a possibility that the Light Objects or Light Spheres could be a helicopter but the way it behaved brings a doubt.   Note the witness is very knowledgeable in commercial and military aircraft.","Blue orb hovered over a tree, 2 doors down from my house in Arnold, MO",MONROVIA,CA,LIGHT,2013,NA,-1.312035098,0,NA,NA,0,NA,-0.867471751,0,0,NA,NA,0,0.695133195,0,NA,NORTH,UNKNOWN

3,11,16,30 min.,"Two objects over Los Angeles on a Sunday afternoon. I was out on my balacony watching two low flying planes for a couple minutes when I noticed a white/reflected object high up in the sky over the two planes. I am not good at estimating distances, however it was a very clear and hot day and the object seemed to be higher up than even the 747's that where landing and taking off from LAX. I watched the object dart around once in a while and go left to right faster than the planes flying into the airport. As the object was at a rest and hovering still another object came from what seemed like nowhere and started circling the other. The two objects were the same size and began to fly what looked like over the two planes only the objects were a lot higher up. This lasted a while and one object would disappear and come back. At this time I called my boyfriend out and after a few minutes of trying to show him where to look he finally saw the object. I told him to keep watching because I just knew the other object would come back out again and start doing what looked like playing with the other object. And it did! It came up right next to the first object and then dropped way down and they both stayed at a hover for a few minutes. My boyfriend had never seen anything like this before that he couldn't explain, and this has been the 5th sighting for me. It felt good to have him see these things because you start to wonder if you are imagining it after a while.

I was pulling out of the parking lot when I first saw the disc-like shape, it did not appear to be traveling at a high speed but as I drove forward, it began to move in the direction of where the sun was.

They said they didn't see anything at first, so I yelled, ""Block the sun!""

I went outside to see 4 very bright lights to the east. They appeared to be quite some distance away but were as bright as the street lights that were just coming on. 2 of them sat perfectly still while the other 2 darted in and out of some low clouds. The 2 lights appeared to be from the same craft.  After a few trips into the clouds, the lights stopped perfectly still. The other 2 lights then took off in a zig zagging pattern. The light streaked behind following the movement pattern. Eventually, all the lights disappeared. The speed of the movement was amazing. During all of this, two of my room mates came home and my neighbors were watching. Everyone saw the same thing.

6,4,22,~10 minutes,"Multiple continuously-luminous craft, flying silently at very high speed, with irregular greenish flashes. This sighting was made during the ""Contact in the Desert"" event, held 3-6 June 2016 at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center (JTRC) in Joshua Tree, CA.  Spanning an approximately 10-minute period beginning at about 10:30 PM, we (my wife and I) observed a total of seven (7) continuously-luminous flying objects approached JTRC at very high speed over the Western horizon (direction of Yucca Valley).   The objects arrived singly, one after the other, and in pairs at irregular intervals over the approximate 10-minute observation period.  None of the objects exhibited standard red, green or white blinking aircraft navigation lights.   Each object flew exceedingly smoothly, silently and rapidly towards the East and then each turned smoothly toward the North/Northeast when they arrived directly North of the JTRC grounds. The distance to the flying craft was estimated to be less than two miles, but could have been as little as one mile away at their closest approach to t! he JTRC.  Throughout their approach from the West and eventual disappearance to the North, the objects emitted a continuous pale bluish/green to soft amber light.  The craft were sufficiently bright and large to be very easily observed without the assistance of night-vision optics or binoculars.  At irregular intervals during their flight trajectories, each craft displayed bright flashes of an iridescent green glow.  The glowing flashes did not appear to emanate from a fixed point on the craft, but rather seemed to be diffuse in nature and sweep over the craft in an uneven manner.  The flash duration was about 1 second or less.  As mentioned above, the craft were fairly close (estimated 1-2 miles) and when the green flashes occurred, it was just possible to make out some kind of hull structure to the craft, i.e., the craft did not appear as sharp points of light or amorphous balls of light.  When the craft were targeted by one or more hand-held lasers, they sometimes flashed green.  But they also flashed a green glow at times when they were n! ot illum inated by lasers.  From its first appearance on the western horizon, each object took about 30 seconds (or possibly less) to complete its west-to-east flyby past the JTRC, perform the sweeping northerly turn, and subsequently gradually disappear over the northern horizon.   The estimated distance of the objects when they first appeared over the western horizon was 5 miles.  Similarly, the estimated distance to the point of disappearance in the north was also 5 miles, resulting in a total (visible) flight trajectory of 10 miles.  Assuming this distance was traveled in 30 seconds or less, the minimum speed of the objects may be estimated at about 1200 miles per hour.  Importantly, no sound of any kind was detected as the objects flew past, which would be consistent with an unconventional (i.e., non-jet engine) type of propulsion system.",Blue Orb,JOSHUA TREE,CA,OVAL,2016,-1.002487858,1.548592151,0,NA,NA,0,0.0642725,-0.988491458,0,0,NA,1.105439476,0,-2.586866855,0,NA,WSW,CLEAR
6,4,22,20 minutes,"100 plus ppl have sighting at Contact in the Desert Conference of 10 very fast muliple colored objects. I will attempt to be succinct in order to keep this report brief.  Please call me for additional details.  I am the Owner of UFO Sighting Tours in Sedona, AZ.  I have completed 588 tours with the use of PVS 7, Gen. 3 Military Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  I was hired by the CITD conference to run their Night Vision Events at this year’s 2016 conference running June 2 thru 6, 2016.  The previous 4 listed reports on this site from Joshua Tree, CA, were from attendees of the Saturday, June 4th event that I led.  I know many additional people that were in attendance who may be contacted for reports/interviews and I may provide phone numbers.   I am a trained observer and a past MUFON investigator.  I was a past member of the Board for MUFON OC, CA. On June 4th well over 100 people were gathered at Orion’s point lookout, a location at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center.  At approx. 10:00 or just prior, most of the attendees witnessed what I am about to describe.  There were 18 pairs of NVGs provided, as well as many individuals privately owned goggles present.  Yet the following were clearly visible with the naked unaided eye and were seen by most present without equipment.  The following sightings lasted approx. 20 minutes total time.  I was busy leading the group and instructing them on a PA system and did not note the time, but many of those present informed me after the fact.  Videos of this event are surfacing and are being gathered.  A professional documentary film crew was present on behalf of CITD and achieved footage of these sightings, but I have not seen it.  I will provide it as soon as it is available. As I witnessed it:  Approaching from the west and flying east across the valley in front of us, and coming low over a hill, were the following large colored lights flying extremely fast.  First to appear was a blue light, then shortly thereafter a red or amber light, and then 2 bright green ones.  After a brief pause of a few minutes came 2 more green ones followed by a single green one, again, flying over the hill at an extremely rapid speed.  This second grouping then slowed way down and came together to form a distinct triangle formation and continued to fly across the valley maintaining this formation traveling all the way in a very slow even pace.  Eventually this formation disappeared from vision right in front of us.  I was not holding NVGs at the time, but those that were said this triangle formation was seen speeding up and shooting up off into space.  Many said that somewhere in this mix was a purple light, but I did not see that.  This was a total thus far of abou! t 7 clearly visible craft. People were yelling out, applauding and very excited during these events.  After a about 5 minutes had passed, Jimmy Church, popular radio talk show host and his wife Rita approached me.  A friend of theirs’s had called them on her cell and told them to come quick!  I informed them they just missed some remarkable sightings.  When suddenly in comes yet another large green light from over the same hill to the west.  And shortly after even another green light.  They witnessed these 2 green lights (naked eye) along with other objects that they saw using the NVGs over the next 10 mins.  Soon after those 2 green ones, a very large amber light came right over us all and very quickly disappeared right above us.  Including this amber one, the total crafts sighted in about 20 minutes was well over 10.  All 10 major sightings were way, way, way too fast to be satellites, completely silent, went from hauling in to slowing down to a snail’s pace immediately, and then completely disappea! red before us.  All of which are things military jets and satellites CAN NOT DO!  We started viewing that night at 8:30 p.m. and didn’t stop till 11:30 p.m. and continued to have sightings on and off the whole while.  I educate everyone on all the various type of planes, shooting stars, and all about satellites in order to be able to rule those out.  Then and only then are we left with unknown or unidentified objects.  All these sightings were clearly unidentified! Also in use were multiple high powered green lasers.  I had brought eight 5-mile, two 10-mile, and one 100-mile visible length of beam lasers and they were distributed throughout the crowd and some people had brought their own.  As these 10 total objects over about 20 minutes were witnessed many people were hitting them with the lasers.  We use the lasers both for pointing out objects and for flashing at them to get possible UFOs to flash back.  This has proven successful on most of my tours.  As these 10 objects were hit by lasers, myself and others realized that while some may have been flashing back in response, that most likely our lasers were hitting actual metallic surfaces and reflecting off of the objects!  Many of the people standing near me, including Jimmy Church, thought this is what we were actually seeing.  This would also mean that these objects were extremely close. The response from the crowd had been overwhelming.  Many people have expressed that this was a paradigm changing event for them.  I’m spoiled.  I get to see real sightings on all my tours.  But this night, same as those, I loved providing that experience for others.  I never get tired of people’s reactions.  For me, it’s always confirmation that UFOs are real and seeing them is truly believing.

8,29,21,35 seconds,"Amber cigar shaped object with segmented light in zig zag pattern, reappearing 3 miles away in a giant ferris wheel shaped object. I was driving N/B on SR-86 approaching the intersection of Aten Road.  This is a metropolitan desert community.  The vicinity is a commercial/light industrial area with farm fields on the outskirts.  The Imperial County Municipal Airport is immediately to the N/W of the intersection.  The weather was clear and there were light streaks of clouds in the sky highlighted by the moonlight.  There was a bright full moon and bright stars. When approximately 1/2 mile from the intersection, I observed just east of me, a dull amber glowing, cigar shaped object in the sky with a zig zag or snake-like pattern of multiple colored individual lights adjacent to the amber object.  The amber portion was much larger than the multiple colored lights.  The multiple colored lights seemed disconnected to the amber object and were all evenly spaced from one another.  The entire group appeared to be at least 500 feet from end to end, again, it did not appear to be solid, but instead, segmented.  The individual lights adjacent to the amber cigar shaped object were yellow, green, red, and blue, respectively. There might have been other colors of lights, but I do not recall. All of the multi-colored lights were rectangular and solid.  There was no display of any sort of blinking night-time aviation flight lights. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of at least 3,000 feet, although it was hard to discern because it was night time.  It appeared to be stationary.  After about 10 seconds, it suddenly disappeared and you could see slight cloud streaks and stars in the background where it had been.  It was not like a solid object that merely blacked out but was still there, in which case it would block out any objects behind it.  Instead, it was completely gone.  About one second later, another object, or possibly the same one, just suddenly appeared from nowhere, about 3 miles further north, probably in the vicinity of SR-86 and Keystone Road., and about 1/4 east of that intersection.  This time, it appeared to be in the form of a giant Ferris wheel in the sky:  the same individual multi-colored lights were in a wheel shape that was vertically turned on its axes and at about a 45 degree angle.  I could not discern whether the center was solid as that portion of it was too dull.  The entire object was surrounded by a very soft white aura or haze.  This too was completely stationary, not moving or rotating.  The entire object was much larger than the previous one that first appeared to the south.  It too was at least 500 feet in diameter.

1,15,9,3 Seconds,"Silver sphere hovers above old Norton AFB, maneuvers quickly and stops. This event happened on Tuesday, January 15, 2008  I was driving on the 30 Freeway in Highland, California at about 9:10 AM heading west past Victoria Avenue. I noticed something that looked like silver sphere hovering in the air to my left, which would be southwest from my location, and I tracked it from my 11 o’clock position to about my 7 o’clock position as I drove in the number one (fast lane) at about 75 mph.  There were no visible rotors, blades or cockpit. It looked solid to me and it was a good distance (1 mile?) away with a good amount of height (300 -500 feet?). I originally estimated its size at about half that of a VW Beetle, but I later changed my mind after comparing the size of the old Norton water tower, which is plainly recognizable as a very large water tower in the distance. I now think the sphere was larger – maybe 10 feet in diameter.  The object caught my attention because it hovered in the sky much higher than a streetlight or radio antenna and did not look like a helicopter, airplane or balloon. In my opinion, the object had no visible means of propulsion (blades/ intake) and no visible cockpit. It was not an obstruction caused by moving traffic or other nearby obstructions. It was in the distance and initially not moving. To me, this is an odd phenomenon, especially on a clear day. As I observed, I watched it maneuver upwards in a reverse “J” – it must have gained in elevation about one or two hundred feet in less than a second. It then stopped or slowed dramatically at the peak of its ascent and moved to the right a bit.  I looked at the object for about three seconds before I lost visual contact due to moving traffic. I could no longer “spot” it because it was now behind me to my left. I looked at a map of San Bernardino and it looked as if it was in the direction of the old Norton Air Force Base (San Bernardino International Airport). I had to take my eyes off the object because I almost drove off the freeway.  At the moment of this observance, I was in the number one (far left) lane with no obstructions from westward traffic or streetlights. My car was clean with no spots on the windshield, there was no glare from the sun and I was sober and alert. The entire event (while short) caused me enough stress to almost crash my car and I immediately called my family and friends to tell them what I saw. I don’t think it was a weather balloon because of the extremely fast movements (stop-maneuver-stop). I don’t know what it was; it was an unidentified flying object. I noticed a change in color from silver or grey to dark grey or black - this was in my opinion caused by the object's shadow, but I'm not 100% sure.  I am a 32-year-old married white male that has experience in practical special effects for film and television, I have 20/15-eyesight with no physical impairments and I am an avid outdoorsman.

I usually sit on the back porch in the afternoons, leaning against the screen door, looking at the cows on the hill. 10 minutes earlier as usual I was quietly observing them.

12,27,20,20 minutes,"UFO was observed as a triangle shaped object with a glowing green light below,  Craft lowered to 1000 feet, hovered  w/ no sound . Object observed was at first thought to be the North Star. The star began moving slowly towards the south east.  As the object moved closer its color was more defined and observed as a large flouresant green light with a light colored haze shadow above the green light.  Object at this time was estimated at least 100,000 feet above the earth.  The object lowered more than X5 in size and hovered slightly north east of our location. At this time my wife and I could see there was some type of ""object"" light gray in color like a shadow that was shaped like a triangle above the green light.  This triangle object was directly over the top of the green light ( same color green as that of a green light used in green for traffic signals) and moved as if it was part of the structure attached to the Object. The Object hovered for approximately four minutes at this position.  The Object then began to lower elevation and proceed directly towards our residence.  At first as the Object was lowering it was hard to tell if the Object was a Craft or some type of balloon because the green light was well below the gray fuzzy Object.  I say fuzzy because the Objects perimiter lines were not clearly defined until the object lowered to approximately 30,000 ft.  The Object which I will now call a Craft continued to lower at an angle in which we could only see the bottom of the Craft and the lower green light which was well beneath the craft.  The Craft slowly came down directly at us taking about three minutes then made some sort of a maneuver at approximately 10,000-15,000 feet tipping forward the ""body structure of the Craft"" and turning towards the westerly direction (San Francisco and Oakland) and stopped. At this time the craft approximately one third mile away and was seen to have a series! of window like structures with clearly defined pilliars.  These solid same as Craft composition pilliars made this front of Craft area look like it had windows only in front and not all around the Craft.  Also, it was hard to tell if this green area was not some type of power source and not windows at all BUT they sure looked like windows to us...  These structures were clearly defined as they were flourescent green in color same as the single green light below the Craft. This Object/Craft only had the solid permanent ""on"" round green light as described above and no type of the required red, green or white flashing navigation type airplane lights. The Craft straighten up again and stopped. The Craft positioned itself so we could only see the bottom again for about 30 seconds.  I tried to take three photos of the Craft and the green light with my camera but the Pic's even though they were in the view area when Pic was taken did not show up on photo.  The Object/Craft was now close enough to see that it appeared to be emitting enough light from the large lower green light to illuminate the bottom of the craft and make it visible to the eye.  The Craft appeared as a semi-flat gray colored triangle shaped object. At ALL times during the observation of the Object/Craft.  There was NO SOUND at all from the Craft and there was some type of energy either emitting from or surrounding the Craft.  This energy would slightly distort the Crafts perimiter lines.  I can only describe this energy or what I am calling energy as someting that would look like heat waves in the desert on a very hot summer day. The Craft after hovering another 30 seconds began to slowly move forward and descend in altitude moving to the west on the approximate approach path in between Oakland International and SFO Airports.  The Craft at this time was approximately 5,000 feet lowering to 2,000 feet and about one quarter mile from our location.  The Craft appeared to be about twice the size of a 747 aircraft. As the Craft slowly moved off in the distance.  One could see as the Craft moved through some thin low clouds (that added more additional light reflecting from the city lights)that the Craft clearly had less distortion from the energy waves.  The extra light gave us a glimps that the Craft's surface was non reflective flat gray to egg shell gray in color and had slighly rounded corners in the triangluar shape. Now at a lower altitude and closer proximity it was much clearer to see the craft. We could see that the green light that emitted light was well below the craft and at least approximately 300! feet lower than the Craft.  At this point, I could not tell if the green light illuminated the bottom of the Craft or the Craft actually had a faint green glow emitting from the Craft. This was because no attaching structure could be visibally seen inbetween the Craft and the lower green light at any time..Especially when the Craft passed through the lighted clouds and became more visible and we could not see any ataching structure to the green light.   The lower green light appeared solid in color, round and seemed have been shaped like a sphere.  The overall size of this green light was approximately 5 percent the size of the Craft. This Craft was stealthy quiet. If we would not have been in our spa watching for satillites we never would have seen this Craft and Event. We watched this Craft slowly move towards San Francisco/Oakland at an estimated 100 mph same as a small private plane's speed almost stop then proceed and continue at an altitude of approximatel 1000 feet until it was out of view.

7,1,23,<5 minutes,"red light over Suisun City, Ca seen from Fairfield, Ca At around 11PM on the 1st, I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I saw a bright red light come over my neighbors house roughly paralleling the flight path of commercial aircraft heading east from the bay area.  It appeared to be travelling in a slight zig-zag pattern and then stopped and hovered, I estimate between 5-10 miles away.   Shortly thereafter, a jet aircraft appeared moving very quickly and I believed that this might be an investigating fighter because of its speed but it continued right on past the red object. It was, I should point out, flying both higher and further away than the object. Within a matter of seconds of this passing, the object descended in a straight line below the trees in the neighborhood and out of sight. I grabbed my video recorder, jumped in my car and headed in that direction but did not find this object again. I have either been an AIr Force brat or active duty myself for all of my 45 years, I believe I know an airplane or helicopter when I see one. And I have seen aircraft on fire with my own two eyes; this object was not on fire. The number of witnesses should be substantial because this siting was near a freeway (I80)which I think westbound must have been pointing almost, if not directly at the object. Highway 12 is also heavily travelled and is about 2 miles closer to the object than I was with nothing but virtually roadless/lightless swamp to its west.

Besides, this object did not behaving like raptors I have viewed before over my neighborhood.   I observed the object for a full five minutes; after which I went to my house to retrieve my bird watching binoculars (@ 1950 hrs).

5,15,14,3 seconds,"Large circular object appears and disappears in place in broad daylight in a clear blue sky. I am posting this 6/29/2012.  I am now 72 and this odd incident happened about six years ago. It was about two in the afternoon (in April or May of 2006 as best I can recall).  The weather was warm, with clear blue sky, no clouds at all. I was alone in my car driving south on Intersate 5 somewhere to the north of Esparto California.  I was doing about 70 mph.  Through my windsheld I suddenly noticed a stationary object dip into view and then right itself, as it righted itself it disappeared in place.  This sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. No lights were visible, and there was no sound, however the edges of the object were &quot;fuzzed&quot; and indistinct.  As far as I could tell the object was saucer-shaped, as if two dinner plates on top of each other and separated by a wall between them.  The front of it tilted down approx 15 degrees from horizontal and then immediately tilted back up again and disappeared as it did so.  It was a smooth motion and seemed appropriate to it's size - not a jerky motion.  My impression was that it was a very large object, possibly two football fields in diameter and it seemed to be about 500-1000 off the ground! , no more than that.  It seemed to be about a mile or two distant from me on the west side of the highway.  I had to chuckle because I had the distinct impression that somebody inside had made an error and had to quickly correct the tilt.  It seemed to me a &quot;cloaking device&quot; had developed a problem.  A second impression later was that this object was half-in and half-out of this dimension, odd as that may sound, since I have absolutely no experience in either cloaking devices or extra dimensions.  I did not pull over or stop because the object had disappeared completely and all I could see was clear blue sky, although I did keep looking as I passed the area.  As I said, the duration of this sighting was no more than 3 seconds.  As I drove further I thought that maybe it had been just a reflection in my windshield of something inside my car, so I tried to re-create a reflection with no luck.  The object itself seemed to be tan/dark tan colored, I coud see no markings, windows or any detail at that distance.  My car is tan and has a tan interior, so that should be taken into consideration when considering a reflection of some sort.  My own out-loud reaction when I noticed the &quot;object&quot; was &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;.  As soon as I finished those words it was gone or disappeared.  There was no noise or lights associated with the object.  There are large electrical transmission towers in that general area.  I am uncertain that what I saw was anything more than a random reflection in my windshield, but I have this sneaking suspicion it was exactly what it seemed to be.  I've never seen a &quot;UFO&quot; before or since, and I'm not really a fan of UFO stuff.  But it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing existed.  But I'm not holding my breath.

It was around 12 that night that I had left a friends house and walked down the street to wait for a ride. Minutes later I noticed a small red/orange glowing orb or sphere in the sky up high and off the horizon.  I was surprised by this due to the fact that it was not a clear night, but instead one with rather low visibility having only a few stars in the sky. At first I thought it was mars, but then quickly dismissed that as the hovering object began to move across the sky about the same speed as a plane, yet with no flashing lights or noise just a silent steady glow.  The object continued to float across the sky in an upward zig zag pattern for a few minutes, which made me think it could have been a red chinese lantern, but I could tell by the size ratio in the sky and the high altitude it was at that this could not be possible. As it approached a nearby star the object stayed motionless, let off a white glow and then faded into a dim light (that could have been mistaken as a star) and then ultimately disappeared and vanished into thin air. After its disappearance I was left in shock feeling uneasy, and overwhelmed, the experience even led me to tears.

We were noticing some small birds gathering near my parents' bird feeder, when we then saw 4-5 large egrets fly over the house.  This in and of itself is rather odd, as that is not a bird we typical see in our area of the Coachella valley. I turned towards where the egrets were coming from and noticed a silver sphere/orb rise above the roof line of the neighboring house.  I would estimate this object to be within a mile of our location and no more than 1,000 off the ground.  It appeared to be a perfect metallic sphere, with no visible wings, engine, windows, landing gear, etc.  The object was also completely silent and no other visible planes were in the area at that time.  My mother and I saw the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared behind a small gathering of clouds. We were about 10 miles away from Palm Springs International Airport and regularly see planes flying above and near the house.  I am also a member of the Palm Springs Air Museum and consider myself an amateur airplane photographer and have the ability and knowledge to identify many types of aircraft.  This was nothing like I have ever seen.","Blue light in the sky, north west of the bend in the Merrimack river.

PD)) On March 10th, as I was driving into my driveway at home, I noticed a halo around the sun. I'd never seen a halo around the sun before, so I parked my car and walked onto the street to get a picture. I took the first picture and noticed that the shot was not centered. I then adjusted my stance to the left, just a bit, and took another picture.  It was better, but it was still off center, so I walked backwards a few steps, and then stepped to the left just a bit, and took the last shot. After I took the shots, I went into my home and forgot about it.  Last night, going through my pictures, I zoomed in on the halo and noticed a small green circle to the left of the halo. I asked my partner what he thought it was.  He thought it was the moon, at first.   I then looked at the next picture.  It was in that one too, except the green circle was inside the halo.  I looked at the next picture.  Sure enough, there it was again, except this time, it had traveled to the other side of the sun with a purplish triangular glow around it.

7,18,22,10 min.,"stadium sized ship slowly rotated 180 degrees then 5-6 silver balls of light slowly flew out - Desert Center, CA On Sunday, July 18, 2010, at about 10:00 pm my sister and I were driving on I-10 West near the Desert Center/Rice Road exit. I was driving.  My sister said, ""Is that a satellite?"" and upon that I look around to see what she’s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.   As I’m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I’m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the ""wings"" suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn’t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.    As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent. The ""ship"" looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This ""ship"" seemed to be ""landed"" after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside. There was no sound from this ""ship.""  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.   The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I’m not 100% certain of that as I don’t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night. I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live. I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I’m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.  Maybe the military is doing something new?

We had no electricity through out the county what so ever.  My wife and kids were on the lap tops. I was just sitting there with them but we had the radio on to see when we can here the electricity would come back on. At 10:00 pm I decided to go outside to see if any of the surrounding housing areas lights had come out. It was very hot as well. I walked in the middle of the culdisak and looked down the street into the valley. As I was looking I glanced up into the sky. I seen an object that was really bright.  I mean real bright! It was green, white, and red bright lights all around it. It's shape was kind of a boomerang or something like that.  The only thing though again it was real bright. As I kept looking at it it was not moving. After about 20 seconds of still looking at it I sai! d to myself that is a UFO. I then seen it move from one area where I will call point A to another point where I will call point B It would go back and forth for around 3 different times to point A and B. It would stop at each location. I say it was around 15,000 ft in the sky. I base that on because an airplane is around 30,000 ft.  The movement to both points were not very fast it seemed like it was cruising. After 3 min or so I was still amazed.  I then ran to my neighbors house accross the street and banged on his door to see if he can comeout and witness what I was looking at. His house was the only one with generator on. But he did not answer.  The object was stil there just going back and forth. I then called a friend named Melinda to run outside of her house so she can see it. I called Melinda because she lived close by. But no Answer. I then called a friend of mine named Jarvis. He lives in South San Diego. He answered and I told him to run outside his house to see if ! he can see the object. He could not see it. I guess he was too! far sou th. After I got off the cell with him I then ran back into my house and yelled to my wife and kids to run outside.They ran outside and I told them to look into the sky. They all looked up and said what is that. I told them this is crazy but this is a UFO an Unidentified flying object! They looked at it and just kept looking at it. I was so excited of seeing it I do not remember how it left. I was tripping out! I will never forget how it looked. Bright green, white, and red lights all over. It was the size of maybe a 727. I also remember it took a dip into the valley and shot back up. Well after my kids and wife looked at it I then went to my front yard and called a few friends to tell them what I saw. They just were listening and asking me questions. After I got off the phone with them I then went back into the house and yelled not to loud but ""I wish I would have recordeed that"".

I quickly turned off my house lights and when I did that, the bright light gradually turned away from me as a searchlight might.  It began to slowly drift toward the northeast, all the while moving the white beam over the foothills.  I could easily see oak trees illuminated by this process.  Occasionally the beam was directed into the sky.  I could not discern the shape of the object (although in my first sighting I saw, dimly, a classic saucer shape).

On May 22, 2012 at about 1pm, my neighbor and I were playing a round of Frisbee golf at the Chico course off highway 32, about 4 miles east of Chico and it is part of Bidwell Upper Park.  I had brought my camera along, Cannon 3.5 mega pixel in the Auto mode.  I wanted to take some vista shots and some shots of my side-arm delivery that is very spastic, lol.  On the 6th (I posted the wrong hole # on my report to CTC website) hole my neighbor took a sequence of 3 pictures (the 3 pictures took less than 3 seconds to take) of me doing my drive from the tee box….. the first one shows my bad form and the white disc already going the wrong direction,lol.  The second one shows me finished with the drive and the disc has already landed.  The third picture is of me staring out in the direction of my errant shot and surveying the trouble I had gotten myself into, lol.   We ran into a young rattlesnake on the next hole, it went on its way and we went on our way.  Other than that, an! uneventful round of Frisbee golf, lol,lol. Well, on Thursday, the 24th I downloaded the pictures and went through them to delete the ones I didn’t want to save.  When I got to these 3 pictures I was blown away by the third one for sure.   In the first one, you only see my white disc and the clouds in the background, the second one shows me finished with follow through and the disc just landed, only the clouds in the sky.  The third one, it looks like I’m staring right at the UFO.  But I did not see it, nor did my neighbor who took the shots and we didn't here anything.  But the digital camera did catch it.  When I magnified it with my Cannon Utilities program it showed a lot of detail of the craft.  I submitted it to CTC on the 25th, they posted it on the 26th in the photo of the day section.  I’ve had 3 e-mails from people saying it was a Tiger Yellowtail Butterfly….. my simple magnification shows a craft, not a yellowtail butterfly.   How come the first 2 didn’t have the butterfly in the picture field? I’m hoping that you will be able to further enhance it and give me your feedback.  It appears to be ¼ to ½ mile away and about 500-1000 feet high, I’m guessing.

7,13,1,20 Minutes,"Oval shaped, color-changing lights, erratic movements, appearing and reappearing. My friend and I were outside in his backyard having a cigarette at about one in the morning when we noticed a strangely-lit object making a steadily-paced arch from left to right across the sky.  Too fast to be a plane, also the lights on the object were like nothing I've seen before on any aircraft.  The object was slightly disk-like, but more substantial.  I would say more oval-shaped than anything.  The lights moved in a horizontal line across the object in a dotty pattern and changed colors from pinkish-red to light green to white. For a short time it was very close but it moved further away, still in our sights but not as clear.  As it moved, the first thing that occurred to me that was odd about the flying object was the sound.  It was completely silent except for when it was closer at first, but even then it didn't sound like any kind of engine at all.  All we heard was a soft whirring wind noise.  Also, its movements were eerie and very strange.  Not like anything I've ever seen or heard of before. When it moved further away, it stopped traveling and started hovering in place.  The lights continued to revolve around itself in that dotty pattern and the only movement it made was a slow swinging from side to side. My friend and I were really weirded out and this point.  We kept trying to verbally convince ourselves that it was a plane or something of that nature, but it was becoming more and more obvious that it wasn't a plane at all. Then we both saw the object vanish into thin air without warning.  But almost a second later it reappeared in a new place directly to the left of its original spot.  We watched it do this several more times, disappearing and reappearing in new locations that were all relatively close together.  Its movements appeared very erratic, but effortless and swift at the same time.  Then the object started traveling towards us.  My friend and I were just staring at it, freaked out.  It looked like it was coming straight for us.  The object was rapidly growing larger in size as it closed the distance between us.  It was then that I noticed more things about the object.  There seemed to be a pinkish-purple haze surrounding it.  Also, the object didn't look remotely metallic or industrial.  It merely looked like an extremely dense concentration of energy in that oval-disky shape with the lights continuing to revolve around it.  I can't say for sure that the object even looked solid.  It was definitely substantial, but it looked to have formed out of a material that I couldn't begin to fathom, even now. It stopped midair and remained completely still for a long ten seconds.  At this time I could clearly make out its shape and the light patterns and color changes.  Then it shot directly over our heads to the left and traveled an insane measure of distance in about half of a second.  I wish I had a better sense of distance so I could be more accurate about this...  Anyway, at this time both my friend and I were convinced that this was something not of this world.  The movement was like no manmade aircraft I've ever seen.  The movement was precise and liquid and smooth when it traveled that fast.  Also, there was no sound.  A plane, number one: could not have gone that fast, and number two: would have made a very loud noise when it was that close to us. It then hovered in the left section of the sky, repeated the same swinging movements from before.  It was slowly moving further away.  My friend and I watched it for a little while longer until it disappeared from sight for good.

After that the opening closed, and the Ball, about the size of a 30 ft  square, seemed to turn and fly away toward the ocean, I went inside and back to bed, I think, pretty sure, I slept till 7 am, the effect seemed to last for three days. Or at least I do not remember being thirsty, I may have drank water during that time but I do not remember being thirsty or hungry, thou I may have eaten something during those couple of days after but again I don't recall.  Which is funny because I may have eaten a lot, my digestive function was strange, and then it went back to normal.

I was driving late at night alone Interstate 8 going Eastbound just East of Campo in late Summer of 2000.  To the North of the Interstate I saw a bright green point of light high in the sky, which then expanded into a bright green triangle (kind of like a fan or an umbrella opening).   The triangle continued to expand to fill a good amount of the sky, and since I was driving on the interstate I was not able to determine how long it remained in the sky nor how big it ended up expanding to.   I watched it for about 15 minutes until I could no longer see it anymore, not because of it disappearing but because I drove away from it.

Thought it was just a party balloon that got loose as I've seen before.  It was too round, so I figured a weather balloon or a test balloon that the hot air balloonists use around here to measure wind currents.   No reference as to size, it could have been a half-mile or more away.  I was concerned because commercial aircraft regularly fly over around 20-30k feet on one leg of the instrument approach to San Francisco Bay area airports.   I continued to watch and noticed a couple of black bands around the balloon at angles to each other that I thought was odd but at the distance it now was any detail was lost.  The balloon continued it's assent and I noticed a few small wispy clouds in a clear sky above where it looked like it was heading.  It reached the clouds and stopped it's ascent and appeared to move back and forth horizontally in short movements.  (In hindsight what appeared to be horizontal was probably a small circular ""holding"" pattern). Directly above the balloon appeared what looked like a fuselage, cylindrical in shape, military gray/silver, like cold-war aircraft.  However just the bottom of a cylinder, no wings or tail and the clouds obscured the ends of the cylinder.  Then the balloon disappeared as well as the cylinder.

8,13,16,15 min,"I observed an object in the north-easterly skies at approximately 4:30 pm on this Saturday. The object became evident when I was observing a private aircraft moving in a northwesterly direction; at the same time an airliner was above it moving in the same general direction towards San Francisco or Oakland airports. As the two aircraft moved and separated I noticed a third 'aircraft' behind and higher then either of the two I had been observing. Under clear blue skies what I thought was another jetliner was in full view and it was not moving and made no noise. It seemed odd that the craft could be so still and yet with the sun in the western skies it was clearly reflecting light as you would see in an aluminum like jet or airplane. I focused on the craft, with the naked eye, and I continued to observe it and clearly saw it was not moving. I deduced it could not possibly be a star because it was too early in the afternoon. I called to my wife to witness this but she declined, but I was able to hail my daughter. Unfortunately, she has a serious eye condition and could not see the object so I told her to bring down my binoculars which she did. With the binoculars I could see the object with more clarity and it appeared oval in shape and the bright aluminum-like reflection seemed to also show a red band? Without the aid of a tripod to steady the binoculars I was pressed to get a clear image. The object remained steady and did not move and I used a reference point to make this observation. I kept watching the object and then told my daughter to get my video cam-corder but she could not find it. After about 5 minutes I had to rest my eyes and had a hard time re-acquiring the object but I did and watched for a few minutes more with the binoculars now resting on the top of a camera tripod - my binoculars have no tripod attach point. Frustrated that no one else was there to witness this I hollered to my wife; as I was waiting for her - having taken my eyes off the object - I turned back to the are! a where the object was and could not locate it. After a few moments I was able to see it for one last time. Now it seemed to have moved away since it seemed much smaller than when I first saw it. By the time my wife came down I lost sight of the object and did not see it again.  I will add that in the general direction of the sighting you will find Travis AF base. From my backyard I will often see military aircraft on occasion; however, my military background and understanding of aircraft lead me to believe this was not a typical aircraft. It was too high and was absolutely still - no movement - and no noise.

Friday, May 29, 2015 at approximately 10:30am, my 11 year old son & I were driving East on Highway 18.  We were roughly 20 minutes West of Big Bear Lake.  The morning was clear.  Blue skies, not a cloud in any direction.   As we were driving on this narrow two-lane, winding road, I saw a shiny, round ball in the sky, I’m guessing it was a couple thousand feet up.  It looked like metal, and reflected the sunlight like a really nice chrome finish on a classic car.  It was textured, like it had different shapes of metal covering the outside; it was not smooth or flawless.   We were listening to music, so I can’t confirm if there was any sound associated with the object.  We had the car windows down, but all I heard was music and the sound of our own engine.   It didn’t look like it was moving, and appeared to be stationary in the sky, although I can’t say that positively because I was in a moving vehicle.  I looked at it intermittently for approximately 5-10 second! s. It didn’t look like it was connected to anything, however I figured it must be. Then we drove around a curve in the road and my view was obscured by trees and hillside.  This mountain area has a good amount of forest cover.  I remember wondering what it could be, and figured once we came around that curve it would be obvious what it was… I was expecting to see the ball connected to something else, maybe on a wire.  It didn’t look like a vehicle of any sort.  But once we were around the curve, maybe 10 seconds later, it wasn’t anywhere to be seen.  I was looking all over, as best as I could while driving, but didn’t see it anywhere. Before I could say anything about it, my son commented about how he had seen a shiny ball in the sky.  He had seen the exact same thing I did.  But like me, now he didn’t see it anywhere either.  We talked about it for a few seconds, then I pulled over to the next turnout on the road, and it happened to be a part of the road which came to an overlook for a huge valley.  We were mainly facing East, but we had a good view in all directions, due to the fact we were at a valley overlook.  There was no shiny metal sphere in any direction, nothing in the sky, nothing on the hillside in the trees.  No balloons, no helicopters. I’m willing to accept any logical explanation, but it didn’t look like anything I can think of, and the fact that it was up in the sky and then gone within a matter of seconds throws me off even more.

As I was looking up (facing south) I noticed there were four stars in a trapezoid shape.  I thought it was strange because I’d never noticed that star constellation before, when all of a sudden the two “stars” on the right side of the trapezoid started to move upwards and westward, together. I called my fiancé out to look. They had a very fluid movement to them, they moved together but sort of drifted a little more together and a little more apart at times.  They moved fairly quickly for what tiny lights we could see.  They looked just like dim stars but the lights pulsated instead of twinkled the way stars do.

From north east from the San Gabriel Mountains, there was an object that looked like a plane but I look further and it was like chrome and had no wings or tail wing.  It was shining light from the sun or its own it appeared.  It came from north east headed south then west slowly. After observing it for 5 minutes it appeared to be a disk to long disk shape and I got a feeling whatever it was it was observing me.  I ran to my car to get my binoculars. Then it took off north west.  About 2000 feet or so I guess it would be the altitude of the object. The mountians tops at the mountain it came from is about 4000 feet.  The direction was from NE over the mountains slowly sweeping down heading West then up again over the mountains heading NW then speeding fast.  It was gone after it went NW.  The flight patterns here I know from years of watching and that object took a different one.  May be a military flight pattern but disk shape?  It did not make noise.

I initially thought it was a helicopter spotlight, but as I watched it, the light appeared to be changing directions and moving in a way that no helicopter or plane could move, that I have ever seen anyway. As I watched it, it looked like the dot of light would drop down and move forward and backward, go up and down – it was so weird. I would have to estimate that the dot of light had to be roughly 10 or so miles in the distance north of the freeway near the hills. The dot itself was like a light blue/white color.

The light was too bright to be a helicopter. I hovered for a bit then moved back and forth. After it became obscured by sme trees I could not see the object again.

Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it's possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn't see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.

This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether.

Right after the sun had set we noticed a bright light in the sky over Wickenburg. It may have been there as we watched the sun go down but we didn't notice it. At first we thought it might be a balloon and the sun was reflecting off it, but it didn't move and it was way to high in the sky. There was some clouds in the sky but it was clear in the immediate area of the object. The objects light looked something like a blue flourescent light would give off only much brighter. I called 911 and asked if there were any reports of anything unusual in the skies over Wickenburg. She said no, but someone had reported something like a ballon over Cave Creek (north Phoenix). At the same time, my wife called a friend of ours in Morristown (halfway to Wickenburg) and had her step outside to observe it. She said there had been reports of lights in the sky, in the same area and at about the same time for the last few days. We continued to watch it and as we got to Wickenburg, we saw people on the sidewalks and parked cars with people outside watching it too. About 45 minutes had passed by now and I went to my back yard and continued to watch it. My neighbor was outside too, and I drew her attention to it. We continued to watch for another 15 or 20 minutes. I took a picture with my phone and the sky took but the object didn't. As we were observing it a jet flew by in the general area  of the object, about 30,000 feet or so, (the passengers must have hadf a real good view of it) and it looked to be 6 or 7 times bigger than the jet.

4,24,14,1 Hour,"Star in broad daylight While working on the Tohono O'oddam Reservation, I observed a star like light in broad daylight directly overhead. My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day.  The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later.  My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since.  Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go's.  I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude.  I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west.

6,9,20,>10 min,"Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near Tucson I was sitting on my front porch facing South on Monday June 9, around 8:00PM, gazing out to the West at the remnants of the sunset against the Tucson mountains. An orange light in the sky appeared against the red-orange-green of the fading daylight. The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it's landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA's runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson's Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways). After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared. After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night. I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this; it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference.

I called my grandsons attention to it and we now watched it earnestly.I was so absorbed I didn't even think of the camera. The object had a dim white outline of lights.It did not have the usual strobes and green/red flashers of conventional aircraft. Since it was silent and unconvential I was now getting pretty excited and so was my grandson. The object continued northwest and began to fly low over the Catalina Mountains.(highest peak around 9,000 ft) As it traveled it began to pickup speed and suddenly it was joined by an F-14 out of Davis Monthan airbase.It appeared to be in pursuit of the craft.The craft began to glow orange,started heading south and 2 more jets scrambled out of the base after it. The object turned blue,changed to a large triangle shape and shot upward. The F-14s stayed with it on its tail and both sides. It then began a sharp fast climb and in a few seconds it left the fighters and was gone. I am now a beleiver in UFO's as this was truly an unidentified flying object.

I had a towel over my face because I had lost my sunglasses but took it off because my face was getting too hot.   I looked up in the sky because I saw some clouds and I hoped they wouldn’t block the sun while I was tanning. I first thought I was seeing eye fluid bubbles, “I don’t know their correct name”, and so I rubbed my eyes and lay starring up at the clouds again not expecting to see anything. Watching the clouds move, I let my eyes relax in a gaze. What I saw were two very little or just really high in the sky, ball shaped, silver objects moving and stopping in and around the clouds. I watched as they moved and stopped and fallowed each other in the sky. After a while one vanished and the other vanished soon after.  I told my sister when she got home but she just said, “Oh”, but that to be expected I guess. So nothing super really happen that day but I got to see two UFO’s and that was really cool.

We were sitting in chairs at the western edge of the Sabino Canyon parking lot and had just watched the fireworks display that  Ventana Canyon Resort puts on for guests.  The sky was heavily overcast over the mountains so when I saw a bright white light appear over the mountains just to the west of the radio towers, I thought it best to turn on my 5X night vision camera and see what it was and I began recording. It was actually 2 lights nearly together in a stationary position far out over the mountains which was easy to tell since the lights were in focus but the radio towers were not since they were closer even though still a few miles away.  Immediately when I turned on the camera, there was a big blue flash near the right side of the lights.  I then zoomed in on the lights and the 2 lights gradually became three in a perfectly spaced row. My camera was mounted on a tripod so the light appeared steady and not moving in the video and that can be gauged also by its relation to the top of the mountain seen below it.  Clearly these lights were in the sky and are not on the mountain itself.   There were big flashes of green lights both near the lights but also well away from them.  Later a similar set of lights appeared out of nowhere next to the original lights to the left of them and when they did the original lights themselves flashed as a large green light. This second set of lights then began to disappear and became a single red light that could be seen moving towards the original lights before it went out.  While trying to get my camera in a better focus there was suddenly a flurry of large flashing lights on all sides of the original lights. The original 3 lights continued to stay in the same place in the sky for a few minutes more and then my camera ran out of memory.  The lights didn't do anything unusual after that but eventually just turned off abruptly.  After about  half an hour the lights came back on in the same location with one bright white light appearing and then 4 more gradually forming a straight line of lights.  They did the same large flashes of light and they appeared to move independently from each other. Lights were seen suddenly appearing and coming from the sides towards the row of lights.  This display lasted several minutes and then just like the first event they all went out like a light switch had been activated. I was with one other person who witnessed the events in a similar way as I did since we were both commenting on what we saw as it occurred.  I wear glasses but my vision is very good.

11,8,4,5-10 minutes,"Bright triangle shaped lights over Tucson skies At 4:50 in the morning on November 8th, my boyfriend - age 20 and myself - age 18 were outside on his back patio while he smoked a cigarette. His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend's house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend's mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside.  In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it's way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend's mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it's side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it.  Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning. My boyfriend had been out smoking on the patio around four in the morning in early July when we noticed what appeared to be a vapor trail that was surrounded by different, glowing colors (namely red, purple and green) in the north east area of the sky. It hung in the air for atleast an hour with all other colors but red fading away slowly. The red glow and vapor trail remained until sun rise. Over the following few days after we had witnessed the trail, people were saying that it was a result of missle testing however I have yet to see any images of missle testing that compare to what I saw that night.",UFO in video at TV news.,TUCSON,AZ,TRIANGLE,2006,-0.897570531,-0.18821725,0,NA,NA,0,2.868934954,-1.069171262,0,0,NA,0.008129116,0,-1.587997275,0,NA,SE,PARTLY CLOUDY

11,8,4,5 min.,"A close view from Tucson, AZ On the morning of the 8th of November I was outside in the early hours of the morning on my back patio having a cigarette with my girlfriend. I was just about to put it out and go inside when she yelled to me and pointed to the north eastern part of the sky. To my amazement I saw what first appeared to be a helicopter but in the seconds there after it was undeniable that this was nothing that I had ever seen before. At first it was an incredibly bright light as if pointing in our direction with a hint of red light with it. The thing I noticed right away was that there was no sound what so ever coming from this thing in the sky. As we watched we saw it grow larger as it came closer and more detail into our line of sight. While it was on the horizon approaching us, it appeared to be the classic saucer shaped object. As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were.  It didn't go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment.  At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.

I rewrote paragraph 2 only, so you can replace the second paragraph with this one.  The rest is the same.  Thanks.  The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6. I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyon! e else s aw it, but no one was around. That in itself was odd.

Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.

There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like ""ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?""  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going. I've never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I'll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There's simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The ""that's not my job"" philosophy definitely applies here. Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don't see any that match this particular sighting.

It was hovering above the mountains, not even moving, then it went straight up into the sky (not horizontally as plane would fly, straight up), at a slow hovering pace, we noticed it first as two pulsing lights, it is really hard to explain.  Then it moved over the sky, right above us, and it was DEFINITELY not a plane.  I really do not know how to describe it, I have never seen anything like it.

9,6,14,1.5 minutes,"Unidentifiable craft moving at extreme speed over Tucson, AZ SEPT 6, 16 I witnessed a triangular shaped craft flying slightly west of Tucson AZ. This craft appeared above a large military jet, the size of a C-130 transport. The smaller triangular shaped craft didn't attract my attention until I noticed the speed and flight pattern it was flying, and then grabbed my eye. The speed at which this craft traveled gave my a wierd feeling, like I was watching a cartoon. It followed a corkscrew pattern with a few slight deviations. It also appeared like it was making a flight pattern similar to a radical roller coaster with the upward corkscrew at tremendous speed, ending with a vertical burst of speed through the clouds leaving my field of vision. Was this a newer fighter jet like the F22.? This event left a lasting impression on me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4,13,10,3-5 minutes,"Orb at Red Roof Inn, Tucson, AZ On April 13, 2002 we were staying at the Red Roof Inn near I-10 and West Ina Rd in Tucson, AZ. We were there for my brother’s funeral. I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother's and grandmother's room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn’t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn’t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn’t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother’s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, “Look at this” and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn’t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, “Oh, a kids balloon” and I said, “No, it’s closer” and she said, “Yeah, you’re right” and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, ‘how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.’ Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn’t. Then finally we couldn’t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn’t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn’t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don’t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother's funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother's name.

3,15,14,15 minutes,"typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show. I can’t give the exact date, but can give you an approximate date because it was during spring training baseball in Tucson.  There also was an airshow going on at nearby  Davis- Monthan Air Force Base.  The year was 2007. My husband, son and I were watching the game, but were distracted by the air show when I noticed idle in the sky between the parks we were at and the airshow was a disk.  I got my son and husband’s attention to see what I was seeing.  Both watched with me for several minutes.  I then turned to a neighbor to the left of me to take a look.  When I turned back to see the UFO it was not visible. I have to go back a second to tell you that I was thinking to myself, ""I see you."" It was not visible to me the rest of the game and so my attention was drawn back to the game.  A couple of hours later we walked back to our car out in the lot and began our drive back home.   We went on with the rest of our day and there was really no other conversation about what we’d seen. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, I was awakened by a lime green light in my face.  I was aware that I had been sound asleep and now I was seeing something that made no sense to me.  It had writing along the edge of it.  It seemed to be suspended at head level with me.  I could not make out the symbols.  The light seemed to have formed the size and shape of a VCR.  I sat looked to the right of me where my husband was sleeping soundly to see where I was just to get my bearings.  The clock was where it was supposed to be, and then I looked to the foot of my bed toward the right where the t.v. sat with its light in the lower corner.  Both the clock and t.v. were red yet what I was seeing was lime fluorescent green. I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that there were 3 small people standing there and one more standing a bit further to the right of the rest.  I have an executive height dresser which sat behind them so I could gauge the height of these little people.  Not one was a full head higher than my dresser. I felt a bit unnerved by this time and turned back toward my husband and wrapped my arms around him and went to sleep.   I didn’t know if they stayed or left and really wanted to feel safe. The next morning very early my son and I went out to the car, the morning dew was still on the window where I saw an unusual hand print of what I only can guess was a thumbprint of some sort and 3 fingers imprinted on the window behind the driver’s seat.  My son and I both looked at it and then looked toward the west where we were met with a very, very bright white light.  So bright it frightened me.  I put my arm around my son and led him back into the house.  He had seen it also. Since that time, we have had occasion to feel some very subtle sensations in our bodies.   I was unaware that my son had a visit from these little people, but he claimed to have had something that woke him too.  I never asked him what all he had experienced that night. Interestingly enough I called my daughter in the bay area to tell her what had happened.  She was in disbelief of course until I told her about the fluorescent green light when she said to me, “mom you aren’t going to believe this, but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second”. I felt that I should say something as time will inevitably fade my memory of events. I suppose it sounds a bit corny to add that I feel we are looked in on from time to time as I believe this area to be somewhat of a hotbed of activity. We were still very new to this area and I always wondered if they were curious or keeping track of the amount of new population growth in this area, but I speculate.  I really have no idea why they were here, but I do know that they were able to keep watch of me at the game, follow me to my car, follow us home and know exactly where I sat in the car and furthermore knew I knew they were aware of me as much as I was aware of them. I don’t have anything else to add, but am unafraid of any repercussions.  I do not drink or take drugs and I’m not crazy.

6,16,21,5 minutes,"Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting. At approx. 21:00 on the night of Sun. June 16th, a friend and I decided to take a night hike of one mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon just on the northeastern edge of Tucson, Az.  The night was totally cloudless and there was enough of a moon to illuminate the nearby mountains and distinguish the mountains from the sky above.  We walked to a turn in the road to a stunning view of the canyon towards the west.  As we proceeded just a few yards farther, I noticed a bright light directly on top of one of the flatter mountain mesas to the southwest.  I was wondering why someone was way up in an almost inaccessible location with a flashlight at that hour of the evening. The light proceeded to move at a walker's pace exactly on the top of the ridge line from left to right.  It then began to move faster than a walker's pace but still appeared to be flashlight size and right on the ridge line.  At times it would disappear and then suddenly reappear farther to the left on a consistent basis. The next time we looked towards that location, there was an object in the sky at 1/2 mile distance away just above the ridge line but very clearly in the sky and not on the ridge itself.  I could see it as more of a straight line than an object such as a saucer or anything definitive other than a faint, thin line in the sky.  I would have to estimate the length of this line as approx. 60 feet with a very faint red light on its end to the left and a very bright light on its right end.  It remained stationary for the rest of the event.  The red light stayed consistently very faint and clearly was not blinking in any fashion.  The white light however was laser precise and did not have the &quot;cheap&quot; star pattern glare of, say, a car headlight. The white light pulsed in an inconsistent way and changed randomly in its sizes.  This part of the event only lasted at the most half a minute.  My friend and I were excited but were also talking about what we had heard about ET experiences.  Many people have related that some alleged ETs are from the star system Zeta Reticula. I was just telling my friend that and precisely when I said the words, ""Zeta Reticula the light abruptly went out and in a split second made a big flash that my friend later said should have illuminated the mountain side due to its brightness.   The light after this went to the relative size it had been earlier. I don't recall how this ""object"" left but in the back of my mind I think it went more to the earlier flashlight sized light and then went out.  This object and lights made no sound whatsoever  and the canyon is a very, very quiet place.  From the beginning of the event to the end the object traversed at most 200 yards of ridge line.  We did not see anything else appear for the rest of our walk up and back. I'm 63 and work in retail.  My friend is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.

7,7,21,1 minute,"Constellation of 14 to 30 dim lights, 3 bright blue lights performing maneuvers. On Thursday, July 7th, 2016, two friends and I were leaving the Star Pass Resort in the Tucson Mountains, west of Tucson, at about 9:30 or so.  After having dinner there, we walked out the east side of the resort headed to the parking lot.  We looked up into the northeastern sky to see a group of “stars” all of moderate intensity among thin wispy clouds centered about 40 degrees above the horizon line.  Because the night was partly cloudy, there were very few stars visible and I found it quite odd to see so many visible “stars” of similar intensity grouped equidistant from one another.  I thought there were about 14-16 lights. One of my two friends believed there were more than 20. He then exclaimed that they were slowly moving.  I looked closer, comparing the relative proximity of two of the lights and was amazed to find he was correct. At that moment, a bright blue light, the brightness of a significant meteorite and much brighter than the other lights, fell straight down, zig zagging slightly before it disappeared from our line of vision behind a wing of the hotel.  At that moment, two other bright blue lights of similar intensity passed over our heads on parallel paths.  We were swearing in amazement quite a bit at this moment.  They continued steadily across the sky until they met up with the more distant, dimmer lights in the misty cloud bank to the northeast.  This took about 15 seconds.  When they joined the other lights they took on the same level of light intensity.  Then they all faded away simultaneously. I am a native of Tucson, 47 years old with a Master’s degree.

7,10,10,30 minutes,"""WE ARE NOT ALONE"" ALIEN CONTACT, AND CONVERSATION July10, 2009!   Last night july 1, 2009, while in tonopah arizona, near the palo verde nuclear plant. We saw a very large triangle shaped UFO. we were driving down a dirt raod, and saw a bright flashing light. we were in the middle of nowhere, when driving down a dirt road, when we saw a flashing light.  we had seen objects here before, and our intentions were to look for ufo's, this is a hot spot. people who live in this area have been chased in there cars, seen objects on a regular basis. It was 10:30pm, we went off road behind some mountains, no sooner had we come around the moutain, we saw the large flashing light. All of us were scared, but at the same time curious. my friends girlfriend was crying and telling us to turn around. we got withing 2 to 300 yards from the light. It was the size of 3 football fields. it was triangle in shape, and windows around it. it was about 3 stories tall, and about 30 feet offf the ground. we flashed our lights and it flashed back, in the same sequence of flashes. my friend James and I gout out and walked closer. the closer we got, the better we could make out what was standing in the windows. there were small big headed aliens, and then 7-to 9foot tall aliens. we based this off the size of the windows. some of the windows you could see through, the other windows were dark, but then the dark windows, cleared up one by one, and as they went clear more and more aliens appeared through the windows. James was video taping the whole time. it was a sureal expierience. i was terrified, but excited at the same time! we walked closer and had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so intense. the craft hovered and then landed. a large pannel at the bottom of the craft opened, and then two aliens proceeded to walk out. this absolutely terrified us more, but we couldn't move or talk. i remember trying to scream, and say run, but we couldn't move, or talk. Heather and Jamie were in the car honking the horn screming to come back, but we couldn't respond or move. the a! liens wa lked up to within 20 feet of us. one of them was very thin and tall, bout 8-9 feet, the other one was about 3-4 feet. we stood there in amazement, shock because we couldn't move or speak. Then a calmness came over us they were speaking to us telepathically. they were saying not to be scared they weren't going to harm us. i remember asking why they were here in my head, and they heard what i was thinking. this conversation went on between the 4 of us for 15-20 minutes. they said they were here to help us, so that we would not destroy our planet, and that there was a horrible event coming soon, that it had to be stopped. james asked if it was something like 911, they commented no bigger, and it would come from the middle east. I was thinking to myself like I had been in this situation before, and the tall alien heard my thoughts, and repeated my name. he said yes henry you have been visited like this before, and he told me. when you were 6 in deming new mexico, you were in the desert exploring, and we talked to you then. I had blocked this out, but it all came back.  they said they new we were coming, and wanted us to warn people of global warming and what was to come if we didn't start taking care of our planet. visions of disaster entered our head, as if to show us what was to come, if we didn't warn people. the taller alien walked closer, and held my hand, and I was no longer scared, neither was James. He said that he would see him again soon, and to warn people about saving aour planet, to both James and I. James was recording the whole time. they turned returned to the craft, and it was gone in a split second. when the craft left, we both fell over like weak, stood up and made our way back to the car. when we got there Heather and Jamie weren't crying anymore, they just hugged us. when we got in the car, it wouldn't start. so we sat there for a minute, and then it just turned on, by its self. like if things couldn't have gotten any wierder. as we started to drive away, three military helicopters apper! eaed, an d were shining light on us. then  5 military hummers showed up, and a chased us. I told James to hide the camera, Jamie and heather started crying. LUke airforce base is about 10 miles away from where were at. I tried running, but over a speaker they told us to pull over or they would be foreced to shoot at us. we pulled over, and military soldiers surrounded the car. Two men dressed in black, opened the door, and asked us to get out. One of them looked like I had seen him before. He asked us to get out and both men in black questioned us, while the military personell searched the car. the men in black asked us what we saw, how long we were there, what we were doing there, if we had any contact with the alien craft. the size, shape, what we saw, if they communicated with us. we answered no to everything, and then one of the soldiers found the video camera. The men in black reviewed it, and said we were not to speak of this. they took the camera, and took me with them. James, heather, and jamie asked where they were taking me, and they said don't worry about it. I left with them and they questioned me in the car. I kept looking at the one man dressed in black because i had seen him before. He asked why i kept starring at him, and said do i look familiar, scared I said no. they questioned me more, on what they said to me, and if I had ever seen or expirenced this before. I said no, and the at the I-10 highway, by the tonopah joes resturant, they let me out and then they were gone. i called James on his cell phone and they picked me up. it was a crazy night, but i had to report this. if anything happens to me James, will contaact someone, at your facility. our evidence is gone, but this really happened. we questioned people who lived in the area this morning, and they all saw the craft, and all the military soon after. this morning while questioning people who lived in the area, they all said that the military helicopters were flying over early in the direction from where they saw the craft. we drove down t! he I-10 to where we turned off of and there were military soldier who had the road blocked off, and helicopter flying to and from that area, so we aren't crazy, and there are 4 of us who wittnessed this, along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft. we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all, but one saw the craft, the other one an old lady said she was asleep, but was woken up by the mititary heleicopters, and they have been going back and forth since midnight last night. I hope my story opens peoples eyes, and they see we are not alone, and the aliens are just trying to help us save our planet, and live peacefully. We are going back again tonight, but taking a different road, I will keep you updated. ((name deleted))",5 fireballs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Location of sighting not specified by source.

9,15,10,10 minutes,"Strange red-orange spherical objects travelling in single file formation in the night sky. I am a 39 year old female with a bachelor’s degree in nursing and one in human biology and on this approximate date of 09/15/2013 I was picking up two clients (male ASU students around the age of 21 years old) at their apartment complex.  As I was waiting outside for them to come out, I noticed several red-orange spherical lights in the sky to the south (they appeared to be in the city of Chandler, just south of Tempe).  They were traveling in sort of an arc, heading first west and then toward the north and finally north-east, at which point they just disappeared.  They moved in a single file line in almost perfect formation.  There was a helicopter traveling along with them.  I watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes before my clients came out.  When the first one came out I pointed it out and we just watched them come up on the horizon, travel in the arc motion and then disappear. By this time we could no longer see the helicopter.  The second client came out after about two minutes and we continued to watch for about 2 minutes as the last lights came and disappeared.  I took three pictures, which are very poor quality, but photographic evidence nevertheless.  We then departed the apartment complex and continued to talk about our experience for about 10 minutes until we arrived at our destination.  We thought that maybe they were Chinese lanterns and that maybe there was a wedding or some type of festival or something.  But the question of why there would be a helicopter travelling with them kept coming up and didn't make sense to any of us. About a month later, I picked up the same clients and we discussed whether any of us had researched the incident but none of us had.  We were still baffled.

On this particular evening, it was hovering in the sky just miles away from an incoming passenger Aircraft (due to the fact that Sky Harbor Airport is only a few miles away). When I noticed it, it was completely stopped in mid-air.  As I watched it for a few more seconds, it started flying south bound, radiated a very bright green light in full motion, and as the green light increased in brightness, the object sped to an unbelievable speed and was completely out of sight in mere seconds.

Normally I see air traffic (lots of airplanes) coming in from the north but this one was coming from a different area and look nothing like the other lights.

6,2,21,5 minutes,"Saucer shape, flying over Tempe, 6-7 white lights making a pattern as flew south. June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm. I live near Rural Road and University, in proximity to ASU’s Tempe campus.  As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the ""aircraft"" from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It’s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight). As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft). To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example. As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor’s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all. I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.

8,23,15,5 Minutes,"Dark stationary craft - hovering at about 1000 feet Attn: Peter Davenport  Subject: UFO  Sighting Area: Village of Oak Creek (VOC), Sedona AZ   Dear Peter, (being I am 72-years of age I will address you as Peter instead of Mr. Davenport.)   This sighting took place in 2003 (the exact day is unknown but I believe it was on August 23rd).   The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property. As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question. For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC; but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer. Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn’t until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted; on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself. As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn’t told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.",6 yellow orbs traveling west then turned south and went out.,SEDONA,AZ,OVAL,2003,0.190946732,0.189794208,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,0.685614483,0,0,0.031025169,0.551841457,0,0.932959285,0,NA,NORTH,LIGHT RAIN

1,4,20,10 seconds,"Emerging, pivoting array of lighted objects. I am filing this report on behalf of my son who witnessed the event.  At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.   A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.   At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.   A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.   At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud ""sonic booms"".   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home. He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.   When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.   Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

11,11,17,2-3 hours,"Bright white light hovering in southern Arizona night sky On November 5th, 2013, I saw a bright white light to the south.  It was around 5pm, dusk with a few scattered clouds (a storm was coming in).  The light had a haze about it and I thought it was a really bright star at first or an airplane.  So I watched it for a 3-4 more minutes to see if it was a plane.  But it began to move erratically, it's behavior nothing like that of a plane nor star.  It appeared to be hovering, bobbing up and down.  Then it would fly up to the left, hover then float back down farther to the right. (distance was hard to tell, though it appeared to be far, but at the same time it almost seemed like it was right above the San Tan Mountains.)  After witnessing the strange behavior, I went inside to get out my astronomy binoculars, ruling out a plane, star or satellite.  Looking through the binoculars showed me the object was spherical, with bright gold lights encompassing the entire object and the lights appeared to be moving clockwise, which I suppose suggests the object was rotating, revolving as it hovered.  We would periodically check on the light every 30 minutes or so and still no change.  At around 8pm the object (while viewed from the astronomy binoculars) appeared to turn towards the south and fly off.  The light became dimmer and smaller until it completely disappeared.  Thinking that was strange and still not knowing what it could be, I dismissed it as nothing, perhaps the military or the coming storm was responsible.  But, I have now seen this object in the sky every night around the same time.  I am really curious as to what this could be.

Want to start off by saying I have never seen this much activity in the sky over San Tan Valley.  I've seen a few things I couldn't explain in the past over this horizon.  Went in my backyard to feed dogs and I looked up in the sky like I always do.  Saw a bright red ""star"" in distance, which I thought was a plane heading straight at me. It got bigger as it approached then stopped in the sky.  It hovered over the San Tan Mountains for a while, then directly under it to the right another white light appeared.  Slowly drifted north.  Then another similar light appeared and did the same.  For a while the three lights formed an Isosceles triangle.  The two white lights drifted toward Chandler/Gilbert area and when they got over the populated area started to flicker like that of an airplane.  But not constant like a planes lights flashing.  The white lights started to flicker a lot and dipped under the horizon out of sight. The red ""star"" stayed still drifting upward slightly.  What I thought was a plane headed towards the red light, then stopped and completely changed directions and drifted upward.  Couldn't believe what I saw.  The red light then started to fade away but not until a bright white orb appeared under it, pulsated, shifted direction and disappeared.  Before the circus ended a smaller red orb drifted up to the red star and almost ""kissed"" it before changing directions and fading away.  Also when all this activity was happening I saw three aircraft in the sky fly by.  One flew almost directly over my house.  Had a big green light under it and I couldn't tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  Made almost no sound at all. The other two flew directly under an orb but must not have seen it.

After arriving home, it was still in the sky, so I grabbed my camera and took a picture.  I was able to zoom in enough to see that it was, in fact, a triangle.

I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting; thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day; not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day; while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn't see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80°, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives' backyard; The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies; and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60°; I called my cousin's boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter's noise flying low in the neighborhood; I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house; flying in circles; it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers; then I turn my sight Northeast at 75° and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn't want to come out, because she's tired of me looking for UFOs; when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45°, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera; a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn't in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90°, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn't in there anymore; I looked for it and I found it East at 75° and it had ascended; I wasn't able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there; I finally got tired and went back into the house; The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for ""my friends"", it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75°; there's always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I'm watching; noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it's been over a month since I've been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he's not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car; I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car; I noticed the UFO East at 80°, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it's visible at 45° over my neighbors tree. I didn't tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked ""Like that one?"". I just smiled and replied to him, ""Yes, just like that one"". ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I've watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times; however, since the time my brother saw that one, I'm not able to see one more sighting.

I lay down on my chaise lounge and looked up with my binoculars and saw what appeared to be a fuzzy white type of sphere much larger than the lights or stars move from east to west and then it suddenly started flashing the red , blue and white lights right in front of my eyes.  I called out my fiancee’ who also watched these lights move from one area of the sky to another, mostly in the south now.  My son came home and watched with us and we all saw two of the strange lights follow an airplane heading southwest—same direction.  At first I thought maybe it was President Obama’s plane with escorts or something, but he spent the night here, so it wasn’t that. The lights moved erratically faster, slower, up or down not in a straight line like an airplane.  I saw many airplanes and could distinguish the difference.

7,28,20,30 minutes,"7 craft seen over N Phoenix, erratic, blinking, changing shapes July 27, 2012: Note: Phoenix, AZ time. At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue. As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot. Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane. This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated. Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed. Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear. Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon. It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us. It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The “plane” that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass. Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction. However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer. My husband and I are serious, well-educated, and professional people and have no reason to be making this up.","5 round objects, hovering, flashing lights.",PHOENIX,AZ,CHANGING,2012,-0.661506547,1.099065012,0,NA,NA,1,0.0642725,1.532752429,0,0,0.215688591,0.186071337,0,0.837828849,0,NA,ESE,LIGHT RAIN

It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I've seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion. What was so strange is the lights of the triangle then began to stretch and the inky blackness of it dissipated and the 3 lights shot off quickly in separate directions.

Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  ""The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds,"" says Sloss.  Many observers noted ""HTV-4 flares"" this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: ""In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.""  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.

The object appeared to be a solid “craft” or aerial vehicle of unknown type.

When first spotted, by the passenger (Right, front seat) the saucer shaped object was hovering, or flying very slowly, with it's circular plane horizontal, or parallel to the ground.  It then tilted, or rotated towards the cars on the freeway, whereupon a single blue and red light (spaced closely together on the forward facing rim) illuminated, and then began “propagating” around the rim, in opposite directions. (Blue lights, clockwise, Red lights, counter-clockwise)  At the same time, it became apparent, the saucer shaped object was domed on it's upper surface.  Also, at the same time, the entire object, or craft was observed to rotate counter clockwise, while the lights around it's rim, remained stationary. The object then began moving north, towards the observer's car, and vanished from sight.

I was driving west on US-60 on trip to Sky Harbor Airport and noticed a bright silvery cylinder shaped object over, I believe, South Chandler.  I was in the distance... Based on a thin cloud bank I would place the altitude at about 8000' so it must have been large.  I first saw it at the 10 o'clock position.  I first thought that it was sunlight on a jet contrail, but as it became larger I thought that it may be a plane on approach to the Mesa Gateway Airport... then it began to recede to the southwest... I almost wrecked the car trying to watch it.   There have got to be hundreds of witnesses, because it was very prominent... It then drifted back into the thin cloud layer and I thought it was gone, but it was bright enough to shine through...  Then from a cylinder it then appeared as two equally sized globes just touching each other...  I had to watch my driving so looked away briefly and thought it had moved away, but you could still see it behind the thin cloud... at one point it appeared to emit a curving smoke trail... then that stopped and the two globes began to sparkle...  I again resumed driving.... the next time I had a chance to look up it was gone... There absolutely have to be other witnesses to this.  It was still daylight and this thing was prominently in view.

Object's length was approximately 7 times its width.  US 60 runs exactly east/west... this object was at the 10 o'clock position. It was nearly sunset.  There are always contrails in the very busy skies...they were all orange and this object was silvery white.  The spheres that It turned into were pretty much the same width as the cylinder appearance, but occupied 1/4 the length of the original cylinder.  It is possible that it was two cylinders side by side that turned so as to make it appear as two spheres... just a guess.  The object stayed double-sphere in appearance until it receded to the southwest... emitted a sinuous smoke emission from the left side of the left sphere which dispersed almost immediately... the object was receding slowly... then it began to sparkle with lights brighter than the initial silvery white appear! ance…  I looked away for not more than 10 seconds...when I looked back it was no longer visible.  It is impossible than no one else saw this... as it was fairly large with an apparent width of your index finger at arms length at its narrowest and was slightly larger upon my initial observation.

It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.

I was standing in the covered porch and I saw a huge red object rising on the other side of my neighbors tree.  I saw the object through the tree branches.   I stepped out into the pool area moving across my decking so I could see the object with out the tree.  I was rising higher than the tree tops.  I thought it was coming from the airport.  It appeared as a fireball, it was not a plane.  I watch the planes fly over all the time.   As I watched a huge chunk of flame fell off and went towards the ground.  It burnt up and was no longer visible.  Then a smaller portion broke off and did the same thing as the first larger piece.  The size of the fireball did not appear to change even though two pieces had fallen off.   The fireball rose higher then completely disappeared.  It did not fall to the ground, it simply disappeared.  I logically thought it was a plane crash.  There was a plane from Sky Harbor that was heading opposite of SW and was climbing into the clouds.  This was absolutely a plane.  A pilot would have been able to see the object from their cockpit.   I called a local news company and there were no sightings or reports.  This was not a meteor, or a shooting star.  Those items are very easy to distinguish and identify.  Has anyone else seen the object this evening?  If so what was it?

7,2,21,~3 minutes,"3 Moving Lights with Large Trails in Phoenix form a Triangle in the Night Sky Lights Over Phoenix, AZ July 2nd, 2016 9:03 PM 	I was sitting on my patio in south Scottsdale near Oldtown, when I heard a loud bang.  As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I’m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there’s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense. 	I’m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I’ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you’ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too. 	Like I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I’m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I’m more than happy to help. I immediately uploaded my video to social media, but for ease of access here is the link to the video I’ve now posted to Youtube.  https://youtu.be/wVpXssN0VK0  	Thank you for your time.

7,10,22,2 hours 55 minutes,"An Orb over Phoenis on July 10, 2006 10pm to 1am About 10:00 pm, A friend and I were complaining about the dog's barking next door as we sat by the pool at a house in Paradise Valley. It was a full moon and we simultaneouly saw a light appear, move and stop about 15,000 feet above downtown Phoenix.  The easiest way for me to explain its movement is to have you hold your extended arm straight out in front of you, then hold your thumb and index finger about four inches apart - that is how far this thing move in a second, after appearing out of nowhere. After acting like a satellite, it just stopped and hovered in the same spot for 20-30 minutes.  We had convinced ourselves that we imagined it before it moved about the same distance in downward and behind a desert tree. Before moving, two airplanes with navagational lights passed over the orb, and Phoenix at approx. 30,000 feet. The orb was a good 5 miles from us.  The round, glowing craft had colors ""scanning"" around it which reflected off what seemed like a mist around it. Two of the lights coming from the orb appeared to scan a wide swath around my friend and I. The first was a bluish color that was wide and tall, and it moved up and down. The second 'beam' was more focused and white, and it seemed to come directly nears us and scan through us in a sideways motion. Pink and red colors were also present in the overall rotational pattern.  About that same time, strange noises were coming from the brush on the other side of the cattle-guard, steel fence surrounding the house and pool area. The nearest house was two hundred yards away with open desert and tall brush between houses.  On two occasions, and in two different areas, I swore that I could see a blue glow that seemed to be coming from a specific point 100 yards into the brush.  The first noise was like a muffled duck call, very quiet and over and over again from different areas. Then the brush moved violently as though something ran through it in one area. Then crackling was heard in another area.  The other noise sounded like pieces of hard wood knocking together because something was moving around, or communicating from different areas of the brushy desert - multiple somethings moving around with them around their necks or something.  The hair was standing all over my body at that point. My friend concurred. I felt as though I was begin watched from outside the fence by something, much like an animal in the zoo must feel.  Then there was a flash (like a camera flash 100 yards away) and all the noise in the brush suddenly stopped. It was deadly quiet! Even the dog quit barking. We joked that the aliens took the dog (it barked again later).   I have since left my friend's house and have been watching the orb.  It is now 12:46 and on the move again. It has now moved two inches straight down and to the right since 12:11 (at least it is straight down the side of my window. By 12:55 it was five inches farther in same direction and then blocked out of my view by highway 202.  It looked like it was slowly going west across the city toward Buckeye when I lost it.

6,8,22,1/2 hr.,"Bright Lights seen West side of Phoenix. My husband and I were traveling back from LA to Phoenix where we resided. I-10  I believe.  We saw in front of us, what seemed to be a glow on the ground, at 2 o'clock from where we were positioned, and saw lights in the air, like balls of light, I'm not sure, but maybe 100 ft up in the air.  There were around six of them, perfectly aligned with the road.  I was pretty freaked out, and so was my husband.  I pulled into the last rest area before you hit Phoenix, and you could still see the lights. The lights looked as if they were stretched out for a couple miles or something. at the rest area, there were two we could distinctly see, I had my camera phone on me, and attempted to take pictures.  One, I believe came out, but the other did not. it just looked like a ball of light, nothing flashy.  After seeing photos of the Phoenix lights, I was amazed at how similar it was, but what I saw was slightly different.  6 lights in the air, one on the ground, (which was the first one we saw) and, these lights did not move, at all.  They stayed stationary, and then faded out.  I stayed at the rest area as long as I could, because I wanted to know if these light thingys moved.  I will be honest, I didn't see any movement.  I tried to look for some sort of form, and I did not see any.  I was looking for any clues besides it was a bright white light, so that I would have some definition to what I said once I confessed my report.  I am sorry for not coming forward sooner.

8,14,3,3 minutes,"Amber-Orange light over Phoenix This sighting of 1 object, occurred in central Phoenix, at 3:33 am, Wednesday, July (sic.  August) 14, 2013. As I walked outside, I immediately noticed an object due north of my position, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. Object moved on a west, north-west to east, south-east heading.  When it seemed to be almost overhead, but still slightly east of my position, it executed a smart left turn for a heading of approximately due east. Object, then abruptly slowed, to approximately half it's previous speed.  It almost came to a full stop, but slowly continued on a due east course for about 45 seconds, then began to dim in brightness, until after another 15 to 20 seconds, the light seemed to just “turn off”. Object was a brilliant orange-amber light, about the size of a green pea held at arms length.  The color and intensity were very vivid, and at first dazzling.  It had a similar appearance, and brilliance to the landing flood lights of a passenger jet coming head on, except the color of the light was a very intense amber-orange.  Duration of this sighting was two and a half, to three minutes. I do not think this object was some sort of “flare” tied to a balloon, although that remains a possibility. 3:30 am on a Wednesday morning does not strike me as good timing for a hoax.  Still, the thought did occur to me.  Upon returning inside my home, I examined three internet based weather stations very close to my home. Weather conditions were, lightly scattered clouds, with calm wind conditions.  All three showed wind conditions of 1 mph or less at the time of this sighting, reporting “calm” with no wind direction indicated.

6,7,22,5 minutes,"Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix The object consisted of three large orange lights, formed in a rather straight line (although the center light seemed to be slightly lower the other two, but only by a hair). Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large; much much larger than any aircraft I’ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor). I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea’s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west; three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look. Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix. From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn’t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange; 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm’s length); 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I’ve ever seen before; and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard. I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway. As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present. Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I’d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this.

About 5:15am this morning, Wednesday, February 22, I took our three dogs out into the backyard.   Looking north, towards West Wing Mountain, I noticed a blue light which appeared to be hovering several hundred feet above the highest peak.  One of my dogs seemed to notice the light as well, as he gazed towards the light.   After maybe twenty seconds, the light increased in its intensity for about five seconds before returning to its previous lower brightness.  I would say that the light increased its brightness by a factor of four or five.  It repeated that pattern of temporarily increasing its brightness three times.   Then, after another twenty seconds or so, it suddenly disappeared as if a switch had been thrown.  My dog then acted very agitated and wanted to go back! inside our home.

3,23,12,5 hours,"Dozens of pink and white orbs and a morphing triangle in the Arizona sky This afternoon about 12 pm (daytime) I noticed an airplane flying overhead moving to the west, and happened to look up. Beneath the aircraft and to the right of it, below it, I witnessed an egg shaped orb hovering about mid-sky.  I went inside to retrieve my binoculars (10x50 5.5 degrees H-15) and I could plainly see two orbs.  One was black and the other was pink or salmon pink in color. The distance was est. 5 miles down range approx.. acute 45 degrees and maintaining position in mid heaven as we faced West. The black orb suddenly dropped near the ground, rose up and then moved rapidly out of view.  The pink orb or egg shaped ball remained in place.  I gave the binoculars to my wife and she watched for about a minute before the pink orb moved rapidly to the lower left of the lens view, and then wisped very quickly to the right of view (northward) and disappeared out of view over the horizon.  Moments later we both saw no less than five objects that appeared to ! be round balls of light.  These balls of light began making erratic movements apparently with no intention.  Several other translucent objects appeared during this time and had the appearance of round luminous plasma, were pinkish in color, and each one had a notch at one end of them.  They looked like a pie with a piece missing.  At times the larger objects would turn facing us and were at least as large as a quarter or a fifty cent piece by binocular view.  Very plain to see. During this time, there appeared to be a meteor storm (streaks in the sky, a sort of white vapor) except for the fact that the streaks moved or skipped vertically in the sky and seemed to defy physics.  After several hours of watching these orbs of light or saucers, moving all over the sky in different directions and formations, and at varied speeds, at about 1:50 pm. what looked like a plasma orb, translucent and pink in color,floating at high altitude and changing shape, began moving toward our house very slowly at about mid sky. Upon reaching a point about a mile(?) downrange and hovering at about 80 degrees overhead, the object suddenly accelerated and flew directly over our neighborhood at what looked to be about 2,000 feet up. Within 5 minutes we heard the sound of F-14's from the local air base firing up. Moments later Four F-14's took off in the same northward direction as the craft had. The events may not be related, but it did add a lot of suspense to the situation.  Observed this at about 3 pm An object, triangular in shape, inverting itself. Looked like red lava in the middle encased by pink triangle, pulsating. Moved slowly to the east, just overhead , then vanished.  After five hours of watching these objects they eventually thinned out to just two or three random sightings, and then just stopped showing up altogether at about 5 pm. This total display lasted 5 hours, from 12 pm. until 5 pm. We heard no sounds associated to these objects and did not meet any aliens, nor do i personally know any aliens.

Currently I work the night shift and conduct night patrols around the perimeter of the property.  Here in Arizona the desert nights are very still with a sky that is crystal clear, the stars are amazing.  It’s so quiet that I hear the small desert rats rustling in the low lying bushes as I walk by them.  I have even walked up upon a bobcat stretched out on a nearby wall. Sunday morning, I was about half way finished with my patrol.  I was walking down a path on the side of the house and had my flashlight out shining it into a dark corner of the house. Right then, a bright flash from above caught my attention.  The strange thing was that I only saw the flash with my left eye as if something was trying to get my attention, although nothing lit up around me.  Another strange occurrence was that I knew to look straight up into the sky.  The light caused the hairs on the back of my neck to instantly rise up. I stopped and looked straight up to see a round bright ball of light above me.  After looking at it for about 30 seconds it disappeared, then moved to the right and lit up again. It was moving slow and methodical.  It was going way to slow to be a falling star or satellite.   As I watched this thing move, it was as if I was trying to talk myself out of what I was witnessing.  When it would reappear it looked as if it was falling a bit and then would stop.  I served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where I have witnessed flares, and this was not a flare, but when it would appear it looked like it was falling like a flair, then would stop, stay still then go dark and move to the northeast.   During the entire time of watching it, I tried to convenience myself that it was something I could explain, until I watched it do something very peculiar. After observing the object for about 5 minutes while it moved slowly to the Northeast towards Fountain Hills, it did a button hook maneuver to the left and headed in the opposite direction of travel.  Almost instantly after the button hook, it conducted another 180 degree turn just as fast and headed towards the Northeast again.  I watch it for about another 2 minutes and then it disappeared. It was something I could not explain.   To remind you this was the area of the famous Phoenix lights.

9,14,19,5 minutes,"Around 7:30 p.m. on September 14, 2015, one of my daughters and I decided to head-out for a walk with our dog.  Literally within 3 minutes, a storm came from nowhere.  As hard rain began to fall and the high winds caused all the trees around us to bend, we all turned back and headed for home. Upon our arrival home, my daughter and I ran into our home drenched.  Laughing, we ran into my husband who had been watching t.v.  We tell him to run and look outside.  It’s incredible how strong the winds are!  Just as he looks outside, my other daughter phones me and she sounds frightened over the phone.  “Mom, I’m scared…you won’t believe what I’m about to tell you.   As I drove home I saw a light I’ve never seen before.  It was a green/blue light that lit up the entire sky, but as it lit up the sky I felt a weird sensation in the car”.  She tells me she is out front of our home but too scared to get out of the car.  We open the door and just as I run to assist her out of the car, a greenish blue light electrified the Arizona sky with a sound that I can only describe as if a live wire hit water.  This light was seen 4 times in a 5 minute period. Although this storm didn’t last very long, the damage was quite severe.  As an Arizona Native for 49 years, I’ve never witnessed such a storm.  Later that evening I decided to catch the news as I was certain they would report what this green bluish light was.  There was nothing!  I immediately went to Google to see if anyone had witnessed what we did.  Sure enough, there were several stories posted.  One in particular caught my attention.  A gentlemen was on the outskirts of Arizona standing outside of his home when he saw something green.  What he described was something quite large in the shape of a ball with blue fire behind it. Another person who was on a military base said he and 2 other gentlemen witnessed this green lightening in the sky.  But they go on to say that they saw an object flying.  It didn’t have the regular white and red lights.  They said there were strange blue lights.  That this object gave off short circuits and arc sounds. The next morning, I called a friend to see if she saw any of this.  Unfortunately, she didn’t see anything as she was inside working.  So, I go back on Google to read her these stories I saw and read last night.  Oddly, I couldn’t find any of the stories I had read.  Not one!  Is it possible that someone removed all these?  I read these stories to my husband the night before…where are they now? It’s odd to me that suddenly I cannot find anything I read on Google that relates to what we witnessed.  Is it possible that these stories were removed?  By whom and why?  Our local news never reported any such sightings.  But I can tell you that both my girls spoke with co-workers who did witness the green lighting and the arc sounds. The United States seems to be having strange storms occurring, tsunami’s, earthquakes, etc….are these caused by UFO’s or our own Government, but something strange is definitely going on…","5:40 a.m. 8/9/06  HugeTriangular Craft Seen flying over  Chatsworth, Ca",PARADISE VALLEY,AZ,CIRCLE,2015,-1.133634516,1.65075741,0,0.075731024,NA,0,0.0642725,0.947823847,1,0,-0.092083779,3.665830316,0,-1.112345093,0,3.401147382,SW,SQUALLS

Pictures are not good, but do show that these objects are far brighter than any other stars or planets.   Rest of the sky is moving west while these remain stationary.   Appears to be two amber lights with one red light.  Seem to be turning as the red light is not always visible.  We watch the sky often after the experience on March 13, 1997.  I looked up and instantly recognized these as non-star/planet & possible UFO.   Object nearly directly overhead emitted flash of light initially...sky was not completely dark at that time at altitude.   Estimate these to be high or very high objects, unable to estimate their flight level.  One airplane did seem to fly between the most east and most north object and turn while doing so but I can't be sure.

As promised I was ready for the next nights event.  If the objects re-appeared I would accept them as planets.  And so it was with much anticipation that I took a chair amongst the cactus to examine the evening sky.  The time was 2025.  Oh the disappointment!  For there they soon appeared in nearly the same place and in the same triangular formation.  Oh well, I’m not the first to be duped by atmospherics. But wait?  These look just like two planets and one star?  These 3 are no where near as brite as on the previous night, and there is no red “navigation” light attached?  What gives here?

It took 3 days and 5 tech’s at Apple to solve the problem.  “I’ve never seen this before, What’s this?  This isn’t right…”  Those and other comments from Apple while trying to restore the computer.

11,14,20,10 mins total,"An object with 9 lights that sometimes flashed from left to right, and were sometimes steady. I was driving Northwest on US 60 from Phoenix to Wickenburg. At about 8:30 pm, appx, I was in the area of US 60 and Jomax Rd. There, there was a racetrack off to the west side of US 60. Above the lights of the facility, though probably a mile or two beyond, I observed ""dancing"" lights, which seemed to move up and down. This motion resembled lightning initially, though the sky was absolutely clear. Then, at the top of the ""dancing"" lights, 9 horizontal lights appeared, then 9 more lights appeared just to the right of those. The width of these horizontal lights were about as wide as a full moon. After 30 seconds or so, they disappeared, and I did not think too much about them, just appeared to be something odd, but distant. Then, a few minutes later, and a few miles further up US60, the horizontal lights re-appeared on the west side of the Highway. Again, they seemed fairly far away, probably 1-2 miles. This time, however, the horizontal lights would blink from left to right, in rapid succession (one at a time). After all 9 lights blinked on the left, they would blink on another object about 1/3 mile to the east. It gave the appearance that there was only one object, but that it would simply move instantaniously from one location to the other. I got this impression because the lights would not blink simoultaneously, just one object at a time. This went on for 3 minutes or so, long enough for me and the car in front of me to slow down to a crawl, and watch the events occur. Finally, they disappear again, only to reappear a little further north, just before the Morristown overpass. Here the lights reappeared. This time, though, the object was very close, at least it seemed. Now, it was close enough for me to faintly make out a shape amongst the now solid, non-blinking lights. The object appeared, from my angle, to be oval shaped. But, the once vertical lights were now elevated in the center. This gave me the impression that the object was actually flat on top and bottom, and round around the! edges ( Disk chaped), but I was just slightly underneath it. Otherwords, if you were to look at a plate from the side at an equal altitude, it would appear flat and straight. But, looking at it from directly underneath, it would appear perfectly round. My view was something in between. But, this third and final sighting lasted a couple of minutes, and the lights appeared steady, and not blinking. Again, the object would appear on the left, disappear, then reappear on the right (a little further away), never illuminating at the same time.

At first I thought it was a planet or star, but as soon as I looked hard it moved slow at first to the right, then accelerated sideways, then stopped and barely moving.  My wife at this time also witnessed the object.   We tried to film it but it was to far in the distance.

8,30,20,1 minute,"I saw 3 orbs of light that had emitted themselves from one another then disappear. 8/30/2017 I was driving to Mesa, AZ, from Globe, AZ, via the US 60.  I had already cleared the city, and was well on my way through the back country of the US 60 when the siting occurred.  It was roughly 20:15 and the sun was still setting to the west.  However, to the east, the sky was already dark.   As I came around a bend on the highway, I glanced towards a dark empty part of the sky.   The bearing of my sight was roughly 120 degrees SSE.  I noticed a light in the sky that appeared to have a reddish orange glow.  Upon further inspection, I noticed this light was more of an orb positioned just over the horizon, but close enough to tell that it was not a star in the sky.   The orb was so odd looking that I could not focus on anything but the light, only taking my eyes off it to glance back at the road.  Having a background in aviation communications I was quick to make the judgement that this was not an anti-collision light of any sort and not an aircraft light that I had seen in the past.  The glow was almost incandescent as opposed to having an LED appearance.  The orb did not waver at all.  It held its position, and that’s what I found so odd about it.   About 15-20 seconds in, the orb shot out an additional orb to the east of it.  The second orb maintained the same position once it shot out from the first orb.  Both orbs now were the same exact size and luminosity.  If I were to guess they were about 100 feet away from each other in the sky.   It was also apparent that the second orb traveled from the first orb to its position because a slight tracer of light was visible; the second orb did not just appear.  It traveled from the first orb to its position.  At this point, there were two identical orbs in the sky and just as I thought that was crazy enough, a third orb shot out from the second orb.  Now 3 identical orbs maintained their positions in the sky.  They did not move or flicker.   Roughly 10-15 seconds after that, they all disappeared rather quick, almost as if they quickly! faded, but it was hard to tell.

So, I am driving in the city of Mesa, Az, on 9:50 am Tuesday, 08/26/2014, it was the first cloudless day we had in last week, being that we are in monsoon season and have had a particularly rainy season this year. I see what at first appears to be a plane at a glance especially being that the area is a fly zone over falcon field and sky harbor.  Then I realize I have never seen anything flying the opposite way of falcon fields mandated flight path allows.  Another detail that had me for a split second assume it was a commercial or private plane was it looked white, and almost textured, but at this time I was looking up at it and may have been looking at the bottom.  Then I noticed it was barely swerving slightly back and forth.  So slightly that unless you stared at like I did it could appear to be going straight.  This is when I was positive it was worth taking a picture at least. If my phone wasn't on verge of dying, I would have taken a video.  As I got my phone ready to take the picture the object was getting further away quickly even though we were traveling same direction.  When I took the picture I wasn't sure if I would be able to see anything.  And when you look at the picture you almost can't see anything until you zoom in then you can see it quite clearly.  So the time I observed it was about 2 min. approximately, OR the time it takes to travel 2 miles at 40 MPH might be a more accurate way to describe it. I snapped the picture, passed two palm trees, looked back up and the object in sky was gone.  Then I saw a commercial airliner fly by and noticed distinct blinking light on the belly and obvious wing shapes which the object I saw was lacking.   I turned east and by the time I got to my destination 2 miles up the road I observed 2 air force jets both flying straight up with the afterburners on and I remember thinking that they were going much slower than the object they were chasing.   The shape of the craft appeared to be somewhat cigar shape and with the white I was seeing is why it looked at a glance like a jetliner but it quickly looked different in shape but I think this is because of the angle not that it changed in shape and became very obvious to me it was wingless.  Half round in shape.  The best thing I can think of to compare with is a bike helmet which is kind of funny to me because I imagine both the helmet and the ship were built with aerodynamics in mind.",8 large bright orange fire balls with no sound following the same path one after another.,MESA,AZ,DISK,2014,-0.123805248,1.548592151,0,-0.278848241,NA,0,7.067218503,0.846974092,0,0,NA,0.008129116,0,-1.112345093,0,NA,ENE,SCATTERED CLOUDS

3,24,19,Less than a minute,"Yellowish amber spheres of light seen over the Sonoran desert. On March 3, 2010, at approximately 7:40 pm, I stepped out on the patio to have a cigarette. I was facing south when I stepped through the door and turned to the east to reach for the pack of cigarettes setting on the table. As I was lighting the cigarette I noticed a light in the sky, about a mile away and about a 1,000 feet in the air.  At first glimpse, I thought it was an airplane headed for Sky Harbor, which is about 20 miles to the west of us. My first thought was that it was coming in awfully low. Then a second light appeared and I wondered where this second plane had come from. I had not seen it approach. A moment later, it occurred to me that they were not planes, the color of the lights was wrong. Instead of being white, they were a soft yellowish amber, similar to the street lights around us ( the street lights were not on at this time).  By the time this thought cleared my mind a third light appeared. Then a forth and a fifth. Though they were aligned in a line, it was not a straight line.  Astounded by what I was seeing, I called my daughter-in-law outside to take a look. That is when the lights began to disappear, first one, then the other four according to the order in which they appeared. They did not fade or twinkle out, they simple were gone, as though someone had flipped a light switch.  My daughter-in-law and I watched this sequence of lights appearing and disappearing four more times. So I cannot say if we saw 5 or 25 lights. But I can say that they were individual. They were not connected to each other or a craft of some sort. The sky was clear and still light enough that we could see that there was nothing else in the sky. No planes, helicopters, or any other air craft. There were no kites or balloons either. And I can say without doubt that they were not flares being dropped as there was nothing there to drop them. Just as they were not fireworks being shot off from the ground. There were no tell tale trails of smoke. And there was no sound.  The whole incident took less than a minute, so even if I had the presence of mind to grab a camera, there was no time to take pictures. I immediately reported the event to MUFON. Two hours later a black helicopter appeared flying about half a mile south of us. It flew in from the west (from Luke perhaps) then came north to circle the EXACT spot the lights had appeared in before it flew off to the south.  I learned later from MUFON that these lights were seen 30 miles southeast of us only five minutes after we witnessed them.  I know these lights were not nuts and bolts objects. In fact, I got the distinct impress while watching these lights that they were alive and popping in and out of our dimension. My personal belief is that they were not ETs but Angels.  As I stated before, I did report this event to MUFON. But when I heard you speak on Coast to Coast I thought you should be aware of my sighting as well.

The light they gave off I can only describe as looking like a dim orange street lamp color, but large and bright enough to be seen very easily.

I lost sight of one of the lights in the back completely, and the other one was still moving in the direction of the other three at a slow pace.  The triangle hovered for roughly three minutes.  After those few minutes, the lights of all three simultaneously faded from bright to nothing, with a bit of flickering, lasting in total around 30 seconds.

It looked to have 4 thruster looking devices on the underside of it.  If I could compare the underside of it to something, it looked like an one of those simon says electronic games.  Each of the 4 thrusters had a flap dangling from the outside rim of the undercarriage.  As the craft would ascend, the flaps would uncover the thruster simultaneously.  If it would descend, the flaps would cover them up.  The top side of the craft (not very visible to me) looked to be a half sphere. The craft's body was a black/dark purple shade.

2,2,17,1 minute,"Very large oval shaped object about the size of the City of Phoenix flying through the clouds. My family and I were driving from Queencreek AZ to our home in Mesa, AZ.  We were on the U.S. 60.   My wife was driving and I looked out in front of me at what I thought was a funny smoke shape about 30 miles plus away.  It had a ribbon like shape and was vertical  thus my thought it was smoke.  However it was in the middle of the horizon and maintained its shape for the entire duration of this experience.  I continued to watch this trying to figure out what it could be.  It seemed to appear and disappear over and over with a waving like motion.  I then saw these round like puffs that looked like something bursting in the air like when you see movies of flack but the ""smoke"" was white in color.  What really seemed strange was that this explosion then seemed to reverse in outward movement to inward and more condensed.  It was then that about 10 Miles away I saw something that looked at first like a hot air balloon going through fog.  It was at that moment that I thought, ""Wow"" there is fog really low going horizontal to the freeway.  Then it appeared again even closer and it the object came into view and looked more like the front end of a blimp, however it was huge.  I thought, wow that fog is alot closer to the ground than I thought and the blimp looked as if it was within 30 feet to the right of us.  It was then that I saw that my eyes seemed to adjust and realize that what I was thinking was a low fog was a very high cloud and around along ways away.  I yelled out loud, ""WHAT IS THAT?  I realized that whatever it was, it was the largest object I had ever seen.  I told my wife to look but she was driving and could not see what I was looking at.  It was at that time that we passed the 202 ramp and the 60 dipped.  I watched the object all the way until the wall next to the freeway covered my view.  My wife kept saying, ""should I pull over?""   I didn't know what to do.  I kept waiting and looking to where I thought it would emerge from the end of the cloud into open blue sky.  It had been! clear a ll day and we where out at our with our friends and so clouds were the last thing I expected.  I did not regain view of the clouds where the object was seen and I told my wife to exit the freeway.  She exited the freeway at power road as I looked into the sky looking back and forth scanning the whole area for a low flying hot air balloon a blimp or something else as the path seemed to be heading toward the opening sky.  We drove north on power until Broadway and never again saw this object.  It was then that I saw  a jet flying in the opposite direction as the object I saw and the jet was still pretty high flying the normal pattern toward PHX Sky Harbor airport.  I gasped when I realized the magnitude of what I had seen.  The object dwarfed the plane like a plane against an upside down mountain.  I continued to reflect back on what I had seen and can only say that it was only the front end blimp shaped in front and the smoke like ribbon was the same object passing through the clouds giving the solid object the smoky like appearance.  It was not a cloud behind another cloud. It was a definite Oval object and I would estimate it from just the nose and from how far away the clouds where that it was bigger than the size of the city of Phoenix.  I don't know what it was, or what it belonged to. I know that I saw something and I know that it was a solid object.  I have never seen anything that big except for a mountain.  It was not a mountain.  The object I saw was skimming through the clouds and because of its huge size it through my perception of the actual distance of the clouds way off.  The planes that flew in toward Sky Harbor were still very high above the ground and the clouds where still higher in the air then they were.  No low flying  clouds.  These clouds where pretty high.","Two groups white orbs one hour apart, each accompanied by smaller red orb over Sydney Australia",MESA,AZ,OVAL,2008,-0.346754567,0.016113267,0,NA,NA,0,5.673597408,-0.867471751,0,0,NA,0.186071337,0,-1.540432056,0,NA,WNW,MOSTLY CLOUDY

While co-piloting a 1959 B-95 Beechcraft ""Travel Air"" between Mesa falcon field (KFFZ) and St. George Utah (KSGU) I witnessed along with two others a spherical craft within approximately one statute mile of our position.

I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.

Driving home southbound on Ralston Rd- a large, very bright yellow/orange light in the southern sky caught my attention. Knowing the sky after living out here for a few years, I quickly made the mental note that it wasn’t a star. As I looked at the light it increased in luminosity rapidly. This increase took place very quickly- I would say within 5 seconds and made the light/object appear to increase in size dramatically. Additional lights then blinked on in quick succession- first one to the east, then one to the west, and another even further west. The additional lights came on at a luminosity that matched the first light. They were evenly spaced, making me wonder if they were separate or part of one large object. All the lights rose simultaneously- moving upward and southward at great speed, disappearing from sight. I have seen numerous things in the night sky out here- this is the first that I cannot come up with an explanation for.

The object was hovering motionless in the air with seven or eight very bright flickering white lights attached in a circle around it. relative to a star, each light appeared to be about the size of the moon however the lights were not in space.  The UFO also had a plasma like coating around it and was completely silent. This event only lasted a duration of about thirty seconds or so.   I rushed into my house to find a camera but by the time I got back outside, the lights had become very dim and faded away. The craft was so advanced in technology, it was like seeing something out of a sci-fi movie. I believe it may have camouflage capabilities and other unknown abilities.

Globe-Miami is about 90 miles east of Phoenix.  We noted an unusual amount of jet traffic in the sky. As we observed the jets, it became apparent that two jets were repeatedly circling and perhaps chasing 3 to four objects situated low in the east sky at an approximate elevation of 20-30 degrees from the horizon.  We assume the jets were military.  The jets were much slower than the objects they were circling.  By compass, we observed the objects between 90-120 degrees east.  We observed these objects for 90 minutes and watched them make extremely erratic maneuvers across the sky at high rates of speed – sudden horizontal to vertical to diagonal reversals and spiraling and stopping across the sky.  The objects appeared to “dance” in the sky.  The maneuvers were beyond the capacity of any aircraft with which we ! are familiar.  We also noted that the normal commercial air traffic to Phoenix in our area seemed to have ceased.  We observed the objects with binoculars of 10x50 and 7x35 powers.  The objects appeared spherical in shape and emanated a white-yellow light.  With the naked eye the spheres seemed about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a large star.  Three of the objects continued to dance erratically in the sky long after the circling jets departed.

We both talked how unusual it was to hear so many military jet passes.  My husband was facing the EAST sky and told me to look.  I saw 2 white-yellow circular lights and 2 objects (white with red lights) in the sky.  The white-yellow circular lights were faster than the other 2 objects in the sky.  It looked like the 2 objects were chasing the circular lights but could not keep up because the circular lights were making erratic moves and were much faster.  One of the circular lights would go right, then make an extreme northern change in direction while the other circular light would go left and disappear and then re-appear.  Then a 3rd and 4th circular light would appear.  Once in a while they would be headed in the same direct! ion and then split off and circle in other directions while the 2 objects (white with red lights) would try and follow them.  At one point, there were 4 white-yellow circular lights and 2 (white objects with red lights).  We continued to occasionally here the military jets (white objects with red lights) over the next 10 minutes and then they disappeared. The next hour we continued to watch 1 to 4  white-yellow circular lights dancing in the sky.  They made impossible erratic movements. A few times the lights would stay in one place, then suddenly race across the sky. The lights would sometimes get larger (as big as a star) with the naked eye, and then change directions and get smaller (1/2 the size of a star).  The UFO’s would occasionally circle instead of making sharp turns.  There was a 5 minute increment that we did not see UFO’s, then they appeared again for another 20 minutes.

We had been moving into our new house all day and after being completely exhausted, we decided to just go to bed and hang up the curtains the next morning.  We have a large, beautiful window in our bedroom which looks out to the mountains.  On this night we were lying in the dark on the bed on our stomachs enjoying the night sky and talking.  I would say it was almost one a.m. As we were looking towards the mountains we saw three lights in a horizontal row in the sky. White in color, fairly large and round.   Could tell that the lights were attached to some sort of a triangular craft.  The lights didn’t blink or change color.  The placement of the lights did move on the structure.  Three lights on the bottom, the middle light went out and re-appeared on the top so that the three lights formed a triangle.  Then the top light went out, moved back to the bottom and two additional white lights appeared on the bottom for a total of five. It was big but not very close. My husband and I were shocked and speechless.  We jumped out of bed  and ran outside to see if we could get a better look.  The craft wasn’t moving, it was at a standstill in the night sky and it was eerily quiet outside.  There were no blinking lights, no red lights or blue.  It wasn’t an airplane because it wasn’t moving.  It just hovered with us staring at it for about ten minutes and then it started floating away slowly and then before we knew it, it zoomed out into the night sky.  It was shocking and unbelievable.  We had heard of the Phoenix lights before but we were always skeptical.

10,7,12,20 minutes,"On October 7th 2012, 12:15 in the afternoon. I was on the tennis court, practicing my serve.  When I tossed the ball in the air I saw a flash almost directly above me. My first thought was that it was a plane but quickly realized that it wasn’t. The object appeared as a long rectangle, like a steel beam used to build sky scrapers. It’s hard to know the exact length but I would guess 25 to 35 feet.  It was shiny silver in color. When I first noticed the object it was around 1000 feet and by the time the object had descended to 200/300 feet it had moved much closer in my direction.  Then the object stopped moving and just hung there.  I began back stepping and briefly looked to the ground and by the time I looked up again to the object it had changed form to a machine looking object made of silver balls. I drew a diagram of the flight pattern from when I spotted the object and I drew two different angles of the object.  The drawings are drawn from the best of my memory and resemble the object very well.....but not exactly. I had binoculars in my car and was able to see the object up close. I did take 3 pictures with my close to useless camera on my cell phone.  The pictures don’t show the object very well. I was awe struck viewing through the binoculars and by the time I had thought of taking pictures the object had traveled a good distance from me.  There are other reasons why I couldn’t take pictures earlier but it doesn’t matter. It is what it is. You have to zoom in on the photos and the object will come into view.  This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet. There was a black mist or haze surrounding the object that was not highly visible. I’m guessing that the haze served as camouflage, blocking some of the shine from the object. Traveling speed was 10 to 15 mph. The object would move a few hundred feet to the north and stop for a few minutes. Then move west a few hundred feet then stop. Then north, then south and so on.

I turned onto Frier DR and 67th Ave in Glendale, AZ at 7:35 P.M when I noticed a light falling from the sky.  I stopped and got out of the car.  It looked like a single Firework falling from the sky instead of going up in the sky.  It was falling from the sky at a fast pace.  It then split into 2 falling “Fireworks” and continued to fall from the sky at a fast pace.  From the speed it was falling from the sky, I figured it was a meteorite.  All of a sudden both falling lights ran into each other and formed 1 falling “Firework”.  It then stopped and formed 5-6 steady lights that just stopped and stayed in one place.  The lights were not in a straight line.  I then started driving towards the objects in the sky.  It felt like I was getting closer to the objects and I thought I was about to see one of the lights up close but some trees got in the way.  By the time I got by the trees it was gone.

The attached pics and vids are taken from our front yard looking directly south. The property is located just northeast of Elliot and Val Vista Roads in Gilbert.  Initially, we saw an object streaking in the southeast sky heading west and descending in a diagonal trajectory.  It had a bright white light with a trailing tail and looked like a falling star, which is what I at first thought it was. It also appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object came to a stop at a position due south of our property and 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object held its position while emitting a significantly dimmer light. I originally thought that it was the spot where the falling star (meteor) had burnt out, but the light remained in the sky at the stopped position.  We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.  It traveled approximately 1/3 the distance to the ground and stopped. It then began heading east (horizontal to the earth).  At that point, the object was intensely bright and appeared to be emitting sparks very much like a fireworks display rocket.  Three additional objects did the same thing, creating a formation about 30 degrees above the horizon at a significant distance below and east of the original object.

10,9,17,8 minutes,"My father and I witnessed 4 stationary disc shaped objects in the sky for around 6 minutes until they vanished. On Saturday October 9, 2010 in Gilbert AZ I was outside playing with my five year old nephew when I looked up in the sky to see what appeared to be a star in the sky. It was around 5:38 PM and I thought that this was odd because the sun wasn’t to set till about another 20 minutes at 6:01 and the sky was clear blue with plenty of sunlight.  I thought it might be a planet so I ran inside to get the binoculars. I came back and located it again as it was the only odd light in the sky. When looking through the scope it appeared to be a circular disc-like object that had a weird reddish light mixed with white light around it that appeared to be changing color. It was stationary and did not have the blinking lights of a plane. I then ran inside to get my father and we got another set of binoculars. I couldn’t find the first object that I saw as it had moved. We then saw four distinct lights in the south southeast sky that had the same appearance as the first.  All four of them were stationary without blinking lights of a plane or movement of a satellite. With the naked eye they looked like faint stars in the sky but once again this was very odd as it was blue sky and before the sunset.  When they were magnified with the binoculars we both were able to see circular disc-like objects. I saw the same red and white lights that were around the first one almost like an orb or aura and appeared to change colors. My father only saw white lights when he looked but clearly saw the circular disc shape of the objects as I did. Three of the objects were in a line and the fourth was up and to the right of the other three. The objects stayed in the sky for around five to six minutes and then they were just gone! . I checked my cell and it was 5:45 PM still 16 minutes before sunset. If they were stars or planets they would have gotten brighter as the sunset occurred but this was not the case as they vanished after observing them for six minutes. They were not a plane or satellite because they did not move or have the blinking lights.","A basket -shaped object, intense orange at the base white ""flames"" at the top standing still in an empty field",GILBERT,AZ,DISK,2010,-0.254951906,1.446426892,0,NA,NA,0,8.478259861,-0.564922485,0,0,NA,0.186071337,0,-2.301475546,0,NA,WEST,CLEAR

Approximately one second later a third light appeared.  The lights then went off in reverse order then came back in the order in which they appeared the first time.  In all there were four white lights.  One was stationary and the three appeared and disappeared in a methodic manner.   It was not totally black out as there was a nearly full moon.  I could make out that it was a craft of some sort as it appeared to rotate slowly. It made no sound. Then, suddenly it was like someone turned off a light switch and it was gone. I got on the phone with my wife and explained to her what I had seen. While on the phone with her I was looking around the sky trying to locate the light. I looked to the North (the complete opposite direction) and way off to the north on the horizon I could see the same light pattern. In both instances the object did not appear to be traveling in a certain direction. On the way back from Somerton AZ two days later I carefully reviewed the area where I had made the sighting.

12,10,20,1 hour,"One to seven bright orange spheres seen for over an hour in Chandler, Arizona, near the Gila River Reservation. At approximately 8:30 PM on Dec 10th, 2014, while driving home from the Phoenix farmers market, I witnessed 3 orange spheres in a triangular formation.   I was traveling southbound down Gilbert Rd, approaching the stop light at Queen Creek Rd, and the objects were to the southwest of my location.  They were solid orange and very bright.   I continued southbound on Gilbert Rd to Ocotillo Rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.   At 8:35 I arrived at my home near the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Ocotillo.  The neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor Christmas decorations.  I pointed the lights out, and they saw them too.  The objects had moved southwest from the original sighting, but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  We watched them for a few minutes and I began getting things from my car.   The neighbors said, “The lights are gone,” and a few minutes later, they said, “There they are again.”  I stepped out of the garage to look, and snapped a photo with my phone.  This time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.   I went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  A few minutes later, after getting my son ready for bed, I looked out the 2nd story window.  I saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line, parallel to the ground but were further west than before.   I ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  They lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.   I finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window. Around 8:55 the lights reappeared and I went to get binoculars.  The binoculars didn’t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  I went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  Then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than they before, so I went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  I took a few more pictures with my phone.  This time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  At 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so I went back out to the balcony.  The light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but I still could not tell what it was.  While I was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other! four. There was a total of seven lights in a straight line. There were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. They were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  They lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but I managed to take some more photos with my phone.  They all disappeared at 9:31 and I went inside. At 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. I continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared. The objects appeared to be near the Gila River Indian community and south of the Chandler Municipal Airport.  Being a former Air force Security Police K-9 handler and living near the municipal airport I know what planes and helicopters look like.   These objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not Chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that I am aware of.   After doing a bit of online research I found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. I called the Chandler Municipal airport and the Chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. I will keep an eye on the sky and maybe I will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.","5 lights flew in perfect formation,  a triangle and two lights in tail,  from south to north.

It appeared as though the object was dipping in the forward direction because the light in the rear was somewhat higher.   All the lights were the same color as I has seen on the reported Phoenix Sighting several years ago.    I turned right on Lake Street (west) at the next intersection.   The lights were still there but the rear light was no longer visible.  I sat in my car and watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  They appeared to be dropping to the right, and my visibility was being blocked by trees.   I turned around and went back to Alma School Rd And turned south and went to the next road by the Safeway Shopping center,  just north of Chandler Heights Rd.  The lights were more visible again for about a minute and then it lowered out of my line of sight.   So I went into the shopping center lot went into the store to purchase a few things.   The lights were gone when I left the store at approximately 20:15.   At that time there were the lights of several planes in the area where I saw the object.

The objects seemed to be travelling back and forth, and each time they changed direction, the fire trail subsided, as if the object was changing direction and we could not see the exhaust at that time. This gave the appearance that the four objects would randomly disappear, and then reappear nearby. The objects seemed to be descending, zigzagging in the same area of the sky.  In just a few minutes, they disappeared. All we could really see was the fire trails, or exhaust plumes of the objects.  Something was obviously leaving fire trails, as they appeared very thick at the source of the trail and thin at the rear of the trail as it burned out. This area of the sky commonly has aircraft passing by, since Sky Harbor airport is nearby.  We could see the light of jets as well, but those were MUCH higher in the sky and further away.

I was driving home from work in Gilbert, AZ, approximately 7:40 PM, turned left onto Alma School Road (heading south) from Guadalupe Road. After driving for about 10-15 seconds, a light in the sky to my left caught my eye.  It was travelling in the same direction as my truck, but much faster.  It immediately appeared to be something unusual as it was an orange flickering orb, flying at about the speed of a small plane, and probably a little lower. I was trying to get a better look, while not causing an accident, and finally had to pull into a small parking lot as I was now sure that this was not a plane or helicopter. After stopping, I got out of my truck and noticed there was another one behind the first.  I watched them going by for a few seconds before getting out my cell phone and taking a video.  Just as I started the video, the second one turned 90 degrees and headed east (it can be seen in the video doing this).  There was no sound whatsoever emanating from them. Only road noise is heard in the video. Looking to my left (North), I suddenly noticed that there was another one, then immediately after, three more behind the first three, in a straight line formation, all heading south except the one that broke off to the East.  The line appeared to stretch almost to the horizon.  As the line progressed south, another one headed east from the same spot that the first did.  I am not sure, but I think it was the 4th in line.  Seeing how far the line went, I kept wondering how many more would show up. Because I was trying to watch and describe what I was seeing on the video at the same time, I lost count.  The total was 6 or 7. Also, it was impossible to see any real shape to them because I couldn't see any defined edges.  It was almost as though it was ""approximately round"", with the edges constantly fluxuating. Because they were orange, and flickering, I thought that they could be Chinese Lanterns, however they were travelling at a fairly high rate of speed, and when I got home I immediately checked the current wind speed on the Internet, which happened to be zero.

It is quiet and fairly light-free in this semi-rural area in Arizona.  Looking towards the West, I see very low on the horizon three amber/yellow lights in a triangle formation.  One was on top, and the other two were below.  The angle was extreme in that the triangle was wide, with the top light not being too far above the bottom two lights.  Their motion was mostly in unison, but some fluttering appeared, showing that they were not attached in any way it seemed.  The lights stayed exactly where they were, not lessening in brightness nor changing color.  After about 10 seconds they appeared to be getting larger, and I assumed this meant they were moving closer. There was a very very slight up + down movement to the lights which could be described as a slight jolting.  And as I was staring at this, they disappeared before my eyes!  Gone.  No afterglow, no sign of them at all.  I moved! all around the area to see if I could see them, but they were gone. I ran inside and texted a friend in NYC, saying ""I think I just saw a UFO"".  He texted back, ""Don't go into the light..."" as a joke.  I returned, ""There were three lights.  Which to go into?"".  The time of these texts and the texts themselves are retrievable.

The cloud looked flat, was vertically oriented, and had perfectly straight sides, and was diamond shaped.  My first thought was that it was some kind of huge kite.  I  looked at it through a spotting scope, and could tell that it was clearly a cloud.

The object looked solid, and had clearly defined edges. It began to move downward, extremely slowly, and changed it's orientation so that it looked almost edge on to our viewpoint, then went behind some low hills just south of the Superstition Mtns.

It moved across the sky above our north  corner of the house out here in Apache Junction I watched it come all the way from the other side of the valley over South Mountain toward my home, and its lights just disappeared.  The lights cut smaller as it got closer and went up.  There was no sound no nothing. It was gone like it went right up.  Nothing like an aircraft when it goes by over head, you hear jets.  I was coming back in and then all the sudden I heard this loud deep rumbling and you couldn't see lights or anything just a odd void.  I have it on video.  Then I started looking up airport flights etc to rule out planes.  I could not believe I witnessed this.  I began to fill out report sitting on my truck when my neighbors friend walked over asking what that noise was.  He was waiting smoking a cigarette, and asked if I seen the weird lights. and then I heard that odd deep rumbling again.  The guy was looking around to see where it was coming from.  He could not see anything nor could I.  That was at 2249..I was working on report so I looked at time on phone.  I and this other guy witnessed a black void go across the sky fast towards the east like the other one.  Only a little further north. It looked to be above the houses next to field.  The guy grabbed my arm when he seen it first, (as I was looking up), pointing at it.  About 6 seconds later we heard another rumble.  I decided I had enough so did he.

When my companion turned off the headlights, at that moment the three lights began to disappear, and the group of aircraft, probably military, began arriving.

10,22,1,5 mins,"October 22nd, 2011, 1:50am Waldenburg, AR, on AR-14. Triangular UFO. My friend and I were passing through Waldenburg, Arkansas on our way to Little Rock. It was somewhere between 1:40 and 2am. Just a few hours ago. For the record: it is October 22nd, 2011. We were headed down AR-14 going toward US-67. It wasn’t long, after hitting Waldenburg, we saw it. We’d pass the closed liquor store and over the railroad tracks. We were just riding and talking with the cd player on low. If you’ve rode down AR-14 at night you notice the red lights on the towers. I’d noticed those because I was watching the road pretty closely to avoid deer and other animals that like to jump out in front of vehicles. We were passing one of the towers, when out of nowhere, just above us,  appeared this huge, dark, black, triangular shape, with three, eerie, and distinct red lights on each corner. I hit the breaks because it freaked me out. I yelled for my friend to look. We both leaned forward and looked up into the sky while still slowly driving at about 3! 0mph in amazement. As it passed over us, or rather we passed under it, I begged her to look out the back window and see if it was still there. I turned the music completely off to see if I could hear any engines. It was completely silent. It seemed to me that the craft was hovering, directly above us. It wasn’t much higher than the tops of the trees.  The lights flashed on and off but not in a specifically timed manner. For lack of better words they sort of dimmed up and down. Never completely off. Whatever was above us was a solid object because within the triangle the stars weren’t showing and all around the object the stars were visible. My first thought was, “Oh my god this is a UFO!!”. My second, was to stop and try to take a picture, but my friend was freaking out as much as I was. She talked me into staying in the car rolling up the windows, locking the doors, and flooring it until we hit the interstate. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about calling the police bu! t they’d think we were insane. We picked up our friend just ou! tside Li ttle Rock and headed back the same way we’d come. It was a few hours later, and feeling braver, we’d tried to figure out logical explanations. The object was gone by then. Whatever it was must’ve descended straight down because we hadn’t noticed it driving toward it. I don’t know of any craft that silent. At least not one that’s also able to descend straight downward so quickly. We tried recreating our first pass by but to no avail. I have no idea what I’d seen. We both agreed on what we saw. Even what it looked like. All I know is after seeing it I must’ve been driving 80-100mph the rest the way toward Little Rock. I was honestly disturbed. I would like to know if anyone else had seen it. I'm making an anonymous email address. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Including but not limited to, me giving him advice on a biblical teaching he had to give to his local fellowship, the topic being, ""fearless living,"" also, talking about whether he made out with his girlfriend on the trampoline, just idle chatter.

As a big fan of aircraft, I tend to check for traffic in the sky.  At 17:35, I looked up and noticed two white craft, one behind the other and slightly to the starboard side of the leading craft.  At first glance the two craft looked military.  Then I noticed how they looked more rounded at the nose which then made me think that they were drones.  This made a lot of sense because the two craft were moving fast relative their altitude.  If they were at a higher elevation then their airspeed would have been pushing supersonic and there were no subsequent sonic booms.  I estimate that these two craft were around 1000 - 1200 feet.  They were traveling from north to south near the I-65 corridor.  The sky was mostly clear, warm, humid, around 85 degrees with a light SE wind.  The two crafts were out of view in under fifteen seconds.  I made a point to try to listen to the noise produced by these craft.

I noticed a light that would be similar to the brightness of Venus directly overhead, but at about 85 degrees, slightly to the west.  I asked my wife if she could see it and she said that she did.

I could not but as I tried, two aircraft in the area allowed my eyes to focus back on the object.   At that moment my wife said that there were now 3 objects.

While I was watching my dogs as they were utilizing the potty/restroom.  I then notice that a passenger jet airplane was flying over from the south-westerly direction heading north-easterly over my residence.  As, the airplane was passing you can hear the thrust of the jet in the distance.  The airplane’s altitude was approximately 27/30,000 feet and it was leaving a contrail in its wake as it passed overhead.  I watched the airplane's trajectory and contrail for approximately 2 or 3 minutes. Something caught my peripheral vision on my right side, and I noticed that something else was in the sky following the passenger jet airplane.  I immediately called my wife from the bedroom where she was changing from her work clothes to lounging clothes.  I wanted her to confirm to me that I was not seeing things or my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Upon her immediate arrival from the bedroom to the outside back concrete deck where I was now standing and watching the sky; I asked her what she was seeing in the sky, and explain it to me in her own words.  The object was approximately 3½ miles behind the jet airplane and traveling at approximately 13/15,000 feet in altitude and following the same trajectory as the passenger jet. The object was triangular in shape, it had no wings, it had no rotary attachments, it was not  leaving any contrail in its wake.  The object was white or of a silver metallic color and material.  The object was traveling at a constant speed and had no noise associated with its flight.  As we both watched the jet airplane travel in the north-easterly direction; we called our son via cellphone who lives 6 houses down the street and asked him to come outside his residence and look to the sky to see what we were seeing.  The object was still traveling as if in tow towards the jet airplane’s direction. As we watched what was happening over our home, our son called us back from his cell phone and informed us to look back towards his residence that there were 2 more triangular, white or silver metallic objects traveling at the same altitude and trajectory as the first object pacing the passenger jet airplane.  All of these objects were traveling at the same distance and speed of each other and approximately 4 to 5 miles apart.  These objects were like the first triangular object in which they to made no noise, had no markings, left no contrail and had no wings or rotary devices attached to them, either.

The road is Old Springville Road in Birmingham, Alabama, in a part of town called Clay, in Jefferson County.  We were about driving down Old springville road, and were about to pass a townhome community named Sommersby. When turning the curve right in front of Sommersby my wife ectstatically yelled, ""Look, Look right there.""  What we both saw was very surreal and chilling.  Off in the distance some 100 yards away, and about 50 ft above this particular grouping of town homes a multileveled, disc-like, object hovered.  It had rectangular lights solidly lit around the perimeter of the disc. It was saucer shaped, and appeared to have four banded levels.  I immediately drove into the neighboorhood to get a closer look, but upon doing this the craft must have been aware and either manuvered away to fast to observe, or cloaked itself.
